Welcome to Day 4 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 275km triangle Gransden-Edgehill-HusBos-Gransden,
 with legs of 125, 85 and 65 km.</p>

<p>A windy day, and the conditions are mixed.  Conditions are good for streeting to the first
turnpoint (although with a 15 kt headwind). The second leg to HusBos should be good although
around HusBos
it may be overconvected.
Conditions will weaken before 15:00, by which time conditions are expected to be
weak with climbs to 3500 foot max. We're expecting a 15 knot headwind on the first
leg, tailwind on the others.</p>

<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
