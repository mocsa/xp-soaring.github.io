Welcome to Day 2 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 330km triangle, with legs of 110, 130 and 90 km.</p>

<p>We are expecting strong conditions in the first part of the afternoon
with average climbs of about 4.5 knots from 12:30, with
conditions weakening rapidly from 15:00. By 15:30 conditions are expected to be
weak and blue, with climbs to 3500 foot max. We're expecting light winds.</p>

<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
