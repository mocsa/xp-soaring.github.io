Welcome to Day 5 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 195km triangle, with legs of 55, 95 and 45 km.</p>

<p>Another difficult windy day, with weak thermals, generally below 3 knots, 
and cloudbase around 3500 feet. The headwind on the first and last leg will be
around 15 knots, with a similar tailwind on the second.</p>

<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
