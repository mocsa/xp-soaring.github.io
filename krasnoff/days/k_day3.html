Welcome to Day 3 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 270km triangle, with legs of 110, 95 and 65 km.</p>

<p>The day is not particularly strong, with average 3.5 knot thermals.
Conditions will weaken rapidly from 14:30, and by 15:00 conditions are expected to be
weak and blue, with climbs to 3500 foot max. We're expecting a light headwind on the first
leg, neutral on the others. Stronger climbs can be expected within
5km of the first turnpoint (i.e. 105 to 115km, at a power station).</p>
<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
