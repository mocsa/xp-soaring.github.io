Welcome to Day 7, the final day of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 420km triangle, with legs of 108, 112, 125 and 75 km.</p>

<p>The best weather of the competition!  Conditions are good with light winds and 4.5
knot climbs to 5000 feet until 4:30pm, and steady deterioration after that.
</p>

<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
