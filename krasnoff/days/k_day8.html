Welcome to the Governor's Cup at Blairstown!
</strong></font></p>
<p>There is <a href="k_help.html" target="top">help</a> available.</p>

<p>The task is 234km from Blairstown via Beltzville, Kutztown, Pottstown Limerick,
PGC, Van Sant and back to Blairstown.</p>

<p>We are expecting good conditions from 12:15, with climbs better than 4 knots
to 5000 feet.  The wind is 10 knots from the Northwest, giving a 5-knot headwind
on the first and last legs, and a 10 knot tailwind on the Kutztown to Pottstown leg.</p>

<p>Note that weaker conditions are expected within 10km of Kutztown (climbs further
apart and weaker, only rising to 4500 feet).</p>

<p>From 14:15, conditions go blue, and climbs deteriorate rapidly.
</p>

<p>To start the simulator click the 'Hunt'
button.  When you are offered a climb, click the 'Climb' button.
When you reach cloudbase, you can alternately 'Hunt' and 'Climb' until you are ready
to start.  Then click the 'Start' button and click a 'Cruise' button to set off on track.
</p>

<p>After that, each time you are offered a climb, you can
select it by clicking the 'Climb' button (and take a 20 second centering penalty),
or you can keep going on track by selecting a 'Cruise' button (and gain a dolphin climb
benefit proportional to the thermal strength).

<p>Note: The 'hunt' button improves your chances of finding a thermal,
but with little progress on track, and to make good progress choose an
appropriate cruise speed for the next expected climb, and don't get too low.
There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
