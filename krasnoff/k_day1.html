<p><strong><font color="green">
Welcome to Day 1 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font> I hope you did well on the practice day.</p>

<p>Today's competition task is a 260km out-and-return, with two legs of 130km.</p>

<p>We are expecting strong conditions with average climbs of about 4.5 knots from 12:30, with
conditions weakening rapidly from 15:00.</p>

<p>The day has light winds, with a 5 knot headwind on the first leg, an expected
4 knot tailwind on the home leg.</p>

<p>To begin, enter your name or competition number in the 'pilot name' box, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
