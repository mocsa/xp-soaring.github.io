<p>This  Schleicher ASG-29 for X-Plane is an 18 meter, flapped, ballast-capable glider with
a very high gliding performance across a wide speed range and a state-of-the-art instrument
panel.
</p>

<p>More detail on the basic soaring calculations and instruments
    is given in the separate article on <a href="../../instruments/index.html">soaring instruments</a>.

<h3 id="variometers">Variometers</h3>

<p>In summary, the upgraded panel includes three variometers. The starting point for all of these is the rate-of-climb
    indicator (which is <i>not</i> on the panel) which would always indicate your current true rate of climb (or sink).
    Unfortunately for soaring pilots this indication is essentially useless as the pilot's movement of the controls will
    dominate the short term reading, creating so-called 'stick thermals'.  The three variometers on the ASK21_B21 panel
    improve upon this in a cumulative three ways:
</p>

<h4>'Winter' Total Energy variometer</h4>
<img src="winter.png"/>

    <p>The Winter Vario (panel bottom left) displays rate-of-climb <i>adjusted</i> to take into account whether the aircraft
        airspeed is increasing or decreasing, referred to as Total Energy compensation.
        If the pilot pushes the stick forwards the glider will sink faster <b>and</b>
        increase in airspeed. If the pilot pulls the stick back the reverse will happen. So a 'pitot' (i.e. the forward
        facing airspeed pressure inlet) bleed can be added to the 'static' (i.e. altitude) pressure feed
        the simple rate-of-climb
        instrument uses to give a <b>compensated</b> reading that cancels out the effect of accelerating
        or decelerating.
    </p>
    <p>The end result is a variometer that shows how fast the glider is climbing or sinking without
        injecting 'stick thermals' every time the pilot moves the controls. The compensation of the vario is easy
        to recognise in flight by pushing and pulling on the stick and you'll see in the short term the needle reading
        doesn't move much where in a pure rate-of-climb indicator the needle would be swinging wildly from lift to sink.
    </p>
    <p>The Winter Vario has a "Maccready Ring" around the outer rim which rotates (use mouse). The small triangle pointer
        on the ring (next to the "50" graphic on the ring in the image above) should be turned clockwise to
        align to the vario reading that
        corresponds to the rate-of-climb expected in the next thermal. The vario needle, as you fly through lift, sink and
        still air, will simultaneously point to <b>two</b> values: (1) the actual lift/sink value on the face of the instrument as
        normal and (2) the value on the <b>ring</b> which suggests the airspeed you should be flying at given this
        lift or sink. More detail on how this works is given after discussion of the computer vario (which does it
        rather better) <a href="#maccready">below</a>.
    </p>

<h4>Netto 57mm slave vario to the computer vario</h4>

<img src="vario_57mm.png"/>

    <p>The panel top-left smaller (57mm) variometer reads the <b>Netto</b> sink/climb rate. This is really simple in concept:
        the sink rate of the glider in <i>still air</i> at the current airspeed is subtracted from the total energy
        reading shown on the Winter Vario described above. If you watch the two varios carefully in flight you'll see
        they appear to move in tandem, with the Netto reading just offset upwards. This amount of offset of the Netto
        needle varies with the speed of the aircraft to match the way the 'still air' sink rate of the aircraft varies
        with airspeed.
    </p>
    <p>The end result is the Netto Vario is showing you the sink rate of the <i>air through which the
        aircraft is flying</i> (as the natural sink of the glider has been deducted). In X-Plane you can witness
        this by choosing a flight in 'clear' weather and once you're off tow the needle will read pretty
        close to zero throughout your flight in spite of you flying at a variety of speeds.
    </p>
    <p>Note the simulated
        instrument doesn't 'cheat' by reading vertical air movement from X-Plane - it does the same calculation as
        is built into the real instrument using airspeed and altimeter climb/descent rates so it is fairly accurate but
        will deviate in certain circumstances such as a low-G push-over just like the real instrument. At very fast or
        very slow airspeeds the aircraft 'polar' calculation calibrated into the instrument can't hope to be perfectly
        accurate so the netto reading will drift in these corners of the flight envelope, again like the real thing.
        </p>

<h4>"302" Computer Vario showing Total Energy or Speed-to-Fly</h4>

<img src="vario_302.png"/>

    <p>The 'Computer Vario' (center of panel, with yellow needle) is by far the most sophisticated of all, but can still be
        interpreted as a simple 'rate-of-climb' indicator. The computer vario can operate in two modes - Total Energy
        (i.e. identical to the Winter Vario described above), and Speed-to-Fly. The instrument is typically used in
        Total Energy mode when thermalling, and Speed-to-Fly mode when cruising between thermals, and on the 'Auto'
        setting will automatically switch between the two.
    </p>
    <h4 id="maccready">The Maccready setting</h4>
    <p>The knob labelled "Mc" in the picture above is used to dial-in a <b>Maccready Setting</b>. This can be
        interpreted different ways but the simplest is as the <b>expected strength of your next climb</b>. I.e. the
        setting has the same units as your vario setting, e.g Knots, and the setting is displayed in the two digits at
        3 o'clock in the picture above in which it is the "0.0" above the 'STF' graphic.
    </p>
    <p>
        The computer vario will do many calculations based on how fast you are intending to fly, a simple example
        being your arrival height at a future waypoint will depend on your sink rate at your planned cruising speed
        with this being related by the glider <a href="../../dev/polar.html">polar</a>. This may sound a circular
        explanation but the vario itself (in Speed-to-Fly mode) will be <i>telling</i> you how fast to fly and the vario
        assumes reasonably you will be mostly following that guidance. But it uses the <i>pilot input</i> for the
        expected strength of thermals to calibrate it's recommended speed-to-fly.
    </p>
    <p>The net of all this is the Maccready
        Setting is the pilot's one communication with the computer vario which then adjusts everything else. The pilot
        learns pretty quickly that in still air a Maccready setting of, say, 3 knots will give a recommended speed of say
        70 knots, or maybe a 4 knot Maccready will recommend 80 knots airspeed.  A perfectly normal use of the
        Maccready setting is for the pilot, with years of experience of how fast they should fly in different
        weather conditions, to turn the Maccready UP when they want to fly a bit faster or DOWN when they feel they
        should be cautious. The computer vario will still do all the calculation trickery to continuously adjust the speed
        appropriately in any lift or sink. (Note the actual speeds in a heavily ballasted racing glider like the
        ASW27 will be <i>much</i> higher)
    </p>
    <p>The Maccready Setting has a special use on <b>final glide</b> (see <a href="#arrival_height">below</a>). It is
        normal for the pilot to fly the course with an optimal cross-country Maccready Setting for the weather,
        say 3.5 knots, and at some point the arrival height for the finish will become positive (happy news). At this
        point the pilot is likely to set off for the finish but may still dolphin in thermals and gain a bit of energy
        on the way so the predicted arrival height continues to improve.  At this point the pilot can turn UP the
        Maccready until that reduces the arrival height to a small margin above the airfield, and then
        follow the Speed-to-Fly much faster to the finish. The extra speed actually provides a built-in safety margin
        but only the pilot experience can assess the expected conditions on the way home to judge accurately the risk of
        landing out.
    </p>
    <h4>Speed to Fly</h4>
    <p>
        In Speed-to-Fly
        mode the variometer behaves <i>like</i> a normal variometer and appears to be indicating lift and sink in
        a fairly coherent manner, but in fact the lift and sink indications have been fundamentally transformed into
        a closely related concept (in soaring) that you should SPEED UP or SLOW DOWN. The general optimal
        practice in soaring is that you SPEED UP IN SINK and SLOW DOWN IN LIFT, and the Speed-to-Fly vario computes
        the <i>optimum</i> speed to fly given the current lift or sink, compares that to your current speed, and moves
        the needle and beeps or buuuurps directly according to how much you should speed up or slow down.
    </p>
    <p>This is more
        complicated to explain than to use in practice - the net effect is a vario that beeps at you to slow down and
        buuuuuurps at you to speed up, which is kind of what any electronic vario is doing although the STF vario does all
        this relative to your current airspeed (and in fact how much water ballast you're carrying, which in the
        ASK21 is zero). The optimal speed for you to fly in <i>still air</i> varies a lot depending on the strength of
        the next climb you're hoping to get, and this provides the baseline around which the STF vario operates. So
        you tell the vario your <i>guess</i> of the strength of the next thermal by turning the knob for the
        <b>Maccready Setting</b> (labelled "Mc" in the picture above).
    </p>
    <p>This is simpler than it sounds - a typical setting might be 3 or 4 knots and you can
        dial that in and leave it for most of your flight, flying between thermals at the speed the STF vario directs you
        to. The Maccready setting ultimately becomes a kind of 'confidence' setting - if you're feeling courageous you turn
        the reading up and the STF will push you to fly faster, using up height at a scary rate but a strong climb will
        make all that worthwhile.
    </p>
    <p>The computer vario also computes 'arrival height' at your next waypoint, using Nav data provided by the
        GPSNav instrument.  This is described below.
    </p>


<h3 id="gpsnav">GPSNav</h3>

<img src="gpsnav.png"/>

<p>The rectangular instrument to the right of the computer vario is the GPSNav instrument, used for navigation and
    feeding details of the next waypoint (such as elevation, bearing, distance to go) into the computer vario.
</p>

<p>A soaring task is loaded into the GPSNav by clicking the 'LOAD' button and responding to the standard X-Plane
    'load flightplan' prompts. You can create a 'task' by using external map-based utilities like Little Navmap
     (Mac, Linux or Windows) or G-Plan (Windows). The GPSNav will pick up the waypoint names and lat/longs from
     the task, and compute the ground elevation at each waypoint using an internal database.
</p>
<p>In the screenshot of the panel above, a task beginning at KSEA (Seattle Airport) has been loaded, which is turnpoint
    1 (i.e. start) out of 2 (hence display 1/2: KSEA).
</p>
<p>The <b>next</b> turnpoint can be selected  at any time with the RIGHT ARROW button, and similarly the LEFT
    ARROW will move you backwards through the task.
</p>
<p>The GPSNav is currently saying KSEA is directly ahead (the single DIRECTION vertical bar). If the turnpoint was
    to the left or right, chevrons would extend in the appropriate direction guiding you in a faily obvious way to turn
    in the appropriate direction.
</p>
<p>The GPSNav is saying the waypoint is 9.7 Km away (the distance units can be changed to miles via USER_SETTINGS.lua, see
    below) and has a ground elevation of 399 feet (again these height units can be changed in USER_SETTINGS.lua).
