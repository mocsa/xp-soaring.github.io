<p>This page isn't a substitute for the detail in the other information provided, it's 
    just a quick summary if you're keen to jump in and fly.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The zip file contains a folder "ASG29_B21" with everything x-plane needs for this aircraft.
    Copy that folder into <tt>&lt;Your&nbsp;X&#8209;Plane&nbsp;Folder&gt;/Aircraft/Extra&nbsp;Aircraft/</tt>
</p>

<p>Start X-Plane and select the ASG29 B21 from the choice of aircraft. The icon on the 
    select screen can be updated when you <i>fly</i> the ASG29 and use the flight window
    menu options "Developer" ... "Regenerate Icons for Current Aircraft".
</p>

<h2>Launch</h2>

<p>Set suitable weather, i.e. thermals and/or wind blowing towards a slope.
</p>

<p>Load a task (X-Plane: .FMS file) via the 'LOAD' button on the Computer Navpanel
    (you create these in tools like Little Navmap or can download them from others).
</p>

<p>Select flap setting "4/A" (using buttons on joystick or keys '1' and '2').
</p>

<p>100% water ballast is ok for experienced pilots on aerotow, max 25% for winch. 
    If new to gliding use zero to 25%. Ballast is dumped
    via the the 'Open' button on the ballast control on the right of the panel. Ballast can be filled (on the
    ground) via the 'faucet' (GB: 'tap') icon on the ballast control.
</p>

<p>The towplane will start towing you as soon as you close the spoilers (X-Plane: speedbrakes) 
    best assigned to joystick axis but default keys '3' and '4'.
</p>

<p>Keep wings level on ground run (this can be difficult as you are slow).
     Once in the air maintain position behind the tow-plane.
</p>

<p>Raise the mainwheel (X-Plane: gear) with a joystick button or the 'G' key.
</p>

<p>At height (e.g. 2500 feet) release from the towplane with a joystick button or the 'space' key.
</p>

<h2>Landing</h2>

<p>Dump ALL the ballast, via the 'Open' button on the ballast control right of panel. 4 minute dump time from full...
</p>

<p>Complete downwind circuit of airfield in flap "4/A" or "5T".
</p>

<p>Gear DOWN with 'G' key - confirm with gear indicator.
</p>

<p>On final approach or before, select "LAND" flap setting. Spoilers at 50%.
</p>

<p>Hold off landing as speed decays, reduce spoilers, but do NOT stall onto runway. On ground run keep the
    stick fully back to prevent a nose-over as long as possible.
</p>

<p>Use 75%-100% spoilers to modulate wheel brake. On tarmac reduce braking to avoid nose-over, particularly
    at the end of the ground run when the elevator will cease working.

                    The wheel brake is linearly operated when the spoilers are opened between 75% and 100% and on tarmac the
                    wheelbrake is easily strong enough to tip the glider onto its nose.

            knots. The 'V' bug on the airspeed indicator (14) shows the still-air speed-to-fly for the chosen
            Maccready setting.

            gear down.

            the adjustment to this speed based on rising or falling air outside the aircraft.

        <td><b>Ballast control and indicator.</b> Shows the amount of water ballast in the wings. Faucet/tap symbol
            can be clicked to fill, open/close buttons control dump valve. 25% ballast is perfectly reasonable for a
            new pilot, at 100% the glider is a handful at low speed e.g. thermalling and flap control is important (do
            not fly slowly unless with positive flaps). Dumping 100% ballast takes 4 minutes. Do NOT land with ballast.
