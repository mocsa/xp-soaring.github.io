<h1>BETA this glider is still in development, including these docs</h1>

<p>This  Schleicher ASG-29 for X-Plane is an 18 meter, flapped, ballast-capable glider with
a very high gliding performance across a wide speed range and a state-of-the-art instrument
panel.
</p>

<h2 id="commands">New X-Plane COMMANDS</h2>

<p>The ASK21_B21 has various x-plane commands built-in that you can assign to joystick buttons or keyboard keys.
    To do so open the Settings screen (2nd from right icon in top right corner of the XP11 screen) and
    select the Keyboard or Joystick tab. There are a lot of keyboard mappings already there as part of
    the default installation so you might want to check these out before you start assigning your own.
    You will see that there are search functions for both commands and keys.
</p>
<p>All the ASK21_B21 commands begin with "b21/...", for example the command to 'Select next waypoint' is
    "b21/nav/next_waypoint". Most of the commands have been designed to be general enough that they can be
    repeated in other gliders (I'm expecting to work on other x-plane gliders) so your keyboard/joystick will
    work the same.
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>b21/trim/trigger</td>
        <td><p>This will set your 'trim' (i.e. the controls-centered steady speed of the aircraft) to match
            the current <b>airspeed</b> of the aircraft. Note this will not necessarily match the current
            pitch (nose up/down attitude) as the aircraft might currently be accelerating.</p>
            <p>On the ground,
            the trigger trim will adjust the speed setting according to the current forward/backward position
            of the stick. If you use a joystick this command can usefully be assigned to the trigger button.
            </p>
            <p>The typical use is to pull the trigger when you've pulled up from fast flight into a thermal so
            setting the trim for about 50 knots for thermalling, and pull the trigger again after exitting the
            thermal and having sped up on cruise.

            If you've read this far, here's a secret tip - the ASK21_B21 on the ground will recognise you
            waggling the ailerons left-right a couple of times as a signal you want your wings levelled. This would
            be a lot more useful if you could actually call an aerotow or winch launch but x-plane at the moment (11.3)
            only allows the launch to happen when you first load the flight. One day we'll improve this.

<p>If you can edit a text file using Notepad, you can tweak the instruments to your preferences. The settings
file at the base of the aircraft folder, and called <b>USER_SETTINGS.lua</b>. The initial settings in this file
are as below. To change the settings, edit the file in any text editor (e.g. Windows Notepad) and save it back to
the same location (i.e. &lt;aircraft root folder, normally ASG29_B21&gt;/USER_SETTINGS.lua). Don't mix up your
upper- and lower-case letters, keep the file name and the settings names exactly as here.

project_settings.VARIO_302_MODE = 1 -- initial operating mode for the 302 vario (0=stf, 1=auto, 2=te)
project_settings.VARIO_302_DUAL_SOUND = 0 -- use alternate 'beep' sound for STF mode vs TE mode (=1 to enable)

    <tr>
        <td>QUIET_CLIMB<br/>QUIET_SINK</td>

            meters per second) and the vario climb tone will be suppressed BELOW this value. QUIET_SINK will be
            a NEGATIVE value where -150 represents 150 feet-per-minute sink and the vario sink tone will be
            suppressed ABOVE this value.  The combination of these two values enables you to fly in relaxed peace so
            long as the computer vario is between these limits. This works particularly well when the vario is in
            'speed-to-fly' mode because you can control the position of the needle by flying at the recommended speed
            or adjusting the Maccready setting to make that the case.

            vario will start fixed in that mode and stay there unless the pilot moves the switch during the flight. If
            <b>1</b> (Auto) is selected, then the initial setting will be to auto-switch between the two modes, selecting
            STF when the glider is cruising in an approximate straight line between thermals, and switching to TE mode as
