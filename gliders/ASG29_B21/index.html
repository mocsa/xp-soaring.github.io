<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>The glider <i>3D model</i> was originally developed for x-plane by the <b>Windsocks</b> team
    in 2007, X-Plane version 8. <b>rhb</b> successfully migrated the model forwards through
    the X-Plane versions arriving mostly intact at the current x-plane version 11. Subsequent 3D
    hacks, flight model, instruments, sounds and plugin animations by <b>B21</b>. Testing by
    the Facebook <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/416567982493369/">X-Plane Gliders</a>
    group.

<h1>BETA this glider is still in development, including these docs</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.alexander-schleicher.de/en/flugzeuge/asg-29/">Schleicher ASG-29</a>
     for X-Plane is an 18 meter, flapped, ballast-capable glider with
a very high gliding performance across a wide speed range and a state-of-the-art instrument
panel.
</p>

<p>If you are new to sim soaring, a much better training aircraft is the
    <a href="../ASK21_B21/index.html">ASK 21</a> which is simpler to fly but has similarly
    capable cross-country instruments so is also suitable for tasks suggested in the 
    <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/416567982493369/">Facebook group</a>.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The ASG29_B21 is a comprehensive upgrade of the original Windsocks ASG29 for X-Plane 7, replacing everything except
    for the 3D model. The instrument panel represents the current most advanced soaring instrumentation for X-Plane
and the flight model has received much attention to ensure the glide
performance (i.e. the <a href="../../dev/polar.html">polar</a>) is close to the real aircraft as possible, resulting in the
highest performance glider currently available in X-Plane.
</p>

<p>There are additional improvements for example in the various sounds, switchable instruments for imperial/metric units, and configurable commands in general intended
to make the glider enjoyable to fly. But it is the programming of the existing and new panel gauges where
the most significant changes have been made.

<h2>Summary of Features</h2>

<ol>
    <li>50:1 glide performance.</li>
    <li>7 flap settings from hi-speed negative
        flap through to thermalling and landing
        flaps.</li>
    <li>Accurately modelled performance with
        water ballast, from full giving exceptional
        high-speed glide performance to empty allowing
        nimble low-speed thermalling.</li>
    <li>Competition-grade variometers giving total energy, netto and speed-to-fly.</li>
    <li>Computer Navpanel instrument using stock X-Plane flightplans for the cross-country task.</li>
    <li>Re-worked flight model for accurate polar and reasonable flight characteristics.</li>
    <li>User settings file provided so default setup can be adjusted, such as the vario sound
        'quiet band' and the units used for speed, height etc in the instruments.</li>
    <li>Updated sounds for general 'wind', spoilers, trim, vario.</li>
    <li>Waypoint arrival height calculation based on computer vario and nav data, to the immediate
        waypoint <i>and around that one to the next</i>.
    </li>
    <li>'Trigger' trim command to set trim to current airspeed. Additional commands added so
        panel buttons (next waypoint, etc) can be configured to joystick or keyboard.</li>
</ol>
