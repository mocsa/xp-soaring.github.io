and the glider will probably survive the landing but the stresses on the wings are likely exceed the limits of the aircraft.
</p>
</div>

<p>For a long time, high-performance gliders have benefitted from an ability to carry additional weight which
can be dumped if the soaring conditions become weak. Aviation regulations permit pilots to eject three things out of aircraft:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>People</li>
</ol>

<p>For various practical reasons, water is the preferred modern choice for this dumpable ballast and
the ASG29 can carry 200 liters (i.e. Kg) of water, adding approximately 50% to the all-up weight of the aircraft
to a max of 600Kg. We
usually refer to the ,a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_loading">wing loading</a> 
of an aircraft (i.e. weight / wing area) rather than simply the weight as this value
is then comparable between different aircraft, with an ASK21 <i>maximum</i> wing loading of 33Kg/m^2 being less than
the ASG29 <i>minimum</i>, and the fully-ballasted maximum for the ASG29 is 57Kg/m^2 which is exceptionally high.
</p>

<p>The use of ballast relies upon one particular and unexpected aspect of glider aerodynamics:</p>

<p><i>When weight is added to a glider, the aircraft will <b>sink faster</b> and also <b>glide faster</b>, and in general
sink speed and airspeed will alter <b>in the same ratio</b></i>.
</p>

<p>This means that the <b>best glide ratio</b> is effectively the same at different levels of ballast but the heavier the glider,
the faster speed at which best glide is achieved. The effect is illustrated in the ASG29 polar diagram (of airspeed vs. sink) for the 
min and max wing-loadings with best glide at 100km/h and 125km/h respectively (54 knots and 67 knots).
</p>

</div>

<p>The rest of this guide will refer to the ASG29 ballast as 0%..100%, as this is how it is displayed in the on-panel
indicator. 100% equates to 200 liters / 200Kg of water ballast.
</p>

<h2>Filling and dumping ballast in the ASG29</h2>
    

<div class="center">
    <p>The ballast indicator is on the lower right of the panel: 
    <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/instruments/ballast.png">
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Filling the ballast</h3>

<p><i>On the ground,</i> the ASG29_B21 will default to starting with 25% ballast. The glider can then be <b>filled</b> with
ballast by clicking the &nbsp; <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/instruments/ballast_fill.png"> &nbsp; icon, at which point the indicator will
read 100% as above. You cannot fill the ballast while in the air...
</p>

<h3>Dumping the ballast</h3>

<p>The <b>OPEN</b> and <b>CLOSE</b> buttons on the ballast indicator control the dump valve.
</p>

<p>From full, the ballast <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">takes 4 minutes to dump</span>. This means on a fast straight
glide to the airfield you will begin dumping 15km / 9 miles away. (At 150kph / 80 knots the distance would be 10km / 6 miles).
</p>

<p>To dump 50% of the ballast, you OPEN the dump valve (for 2 minutes) and then CLOSE it again.
</p>

<h2>Flying the ASG29 with water ballast</h2>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<h4>Winch</h4>

<p>It would be relatively unusual to winch launch the ASG29 <i>at all</i> as it is an expensive aircraft, and even more
unlikely to be carry water ballast during a winch launch. The issue is the relatively high risk of a launch failure when the 
ballast would make the ASG29 more difficult to handle and have zero chance of dumping the ballast before landing.
</p>

<p>The X-Plane default of 25% ballast is probably the maximum reasonable for a winch launch in the ASG29.
