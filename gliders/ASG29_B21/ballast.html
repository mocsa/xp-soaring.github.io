<h2>Ballast concepts</h2>

<p>Flying with ballast is conceptually simple - in strong conditions carry a lot, in weak conditions don't.
</p>

<p>For a long time, high-performance gliders have benefitted from an ability to carry additional weight which
can be dumped if the soaring conditions become weak. Aviation regulations permit pilots to eject three things out of aircraft:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>People</li>
</ol>

<p>For various practical reasons, water is the modern choice for dumpable ballast and
the ASG29 can carry 200 liters (i.e. 200Kg) of water, adding approximately 50% to the all-up weight of the aircraft
to a max of 600Kg. We
usually refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_loading">wing loading</a> 
of an aircraft (i.e. weight / wing area) rather than simply the weight as this value
is then comparable between different aircraft, with an ASK21 <i>maximum</i> wing loading of 33Kg/m^2 being less than
the ASG29 <i>minimum</i>, and the fully-ballasted maximum for the ASG29 is 57Kg/m^2 which is exceptionally high.
</p>

<p>The conventional expectation is that a 'high wing loading' aircraft will feel most comfortable flying in a straight line at
    high speed but will feel aerodynamically cumbersome at low speed and in tight turns. In contrast a 'low wing loading'
    aircraft will feel light, agile and maneuverable at low speeds but will spectacularly fail to accelerate when you push the nose
    down. Glider pilots used to ridge soaring in a heavily ballasted glider will describe an unballasted glider as feeling "like
    its tail is tied to a tree". Early-time pilots used to lightweight training gliders will be shocked at how unmaneuverable a
    fully ballasted glider can be, particularly during the ground run of an aerotow.
</p>

<p>A remarkable achievement of the ASG29 design is that it remains flyable at every corner of the flaps and ballast envelope, across
    a very high range of speed and wing loading.
</p>

    <p>The use of ballast exploits the following unexpected fact of glider aerodynamics:</p>

<p><i>When weight is added to a glider, the aircraft will both <b>sink faster</b> and also <b>glide faster</b>, and in general
sink speed and airspeed will alter <b>in the same ratio</b></i>.
</p>

<p>This means that the <b>best glide ratio</b> is effectively the same at different levels of ballast. However, the heavier the glider,
the faster speed at which best glide is achieved. The effect is illustrated in the ASG29 polar diagram (of airspeed vs. sink) for the 
min and max wing-loadings with similar best glide at 100km/h and 125km/h respectively (54 knots and 67 knots). The ASG29
absolute best glide is achieved in flap setting '1' with approx 50% ballast.
</p>

</div>

<p>The rest of this guide will refer to the ASG29 ballast as 0%..100%, as this is how it is displayed in the on-panel
indicator. 100% equates to 200 liters / 200Kg of water ballast.
</p>

<h2>Filling and dumping ballast in the ASG29</h2>

<div class="center">
    <p>The ballast indicator is on the lower right of the panel: 
    <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/instruments/ballast.png">
    </p>
</div>

<p>X-Plane <a href="installation.html#commands">commands</a> are available if you prefer to set a joystick button or key to control
    the fill and dump valve open / close.
</p>

<h3>Filling the ballast</h3>

<p><i>On the ground,</i> the ASG29_B21 will default to starting with 25% ballast. The glider can then be <b>filled</b> with
ballast by clicking the &nbsp; <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="images/instruments/ballast_fill.png"> &nbsp; icon, at which point the indicator will
read 100% as above. You cannot fill the ballast while in the air...
</p>

<h3>Dumping the ballast</h3>

<p>The <b>OPEN</b> and <b>CLOSE</b> buttons on the ballast indicator control the dump valve.
</p>

<p>From full, the ballast <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">takes 4 minutes to dump</span>. This means on a fast straight
glide to the airfield you will begin dumping 15km / 9 miles away. (At 150kph / 80 knots the distance would be 10km / 6 miles).
</p>

<p>For a partial dump of the ballast, simply OPEN the dump valve until the indicator shows the required amount and then CLOSE it again.
</p>

<h2>Flying the ASG29 with water ballast</h2>

<h3>Launching</h3>

<p>Be aware that any ballast on board will make the glider more difficult to handle during the ground run. A cross-wind will be
    particularly problematic.
</p>

<p>You can make life considerably easier by launching with a headwind blowing straight down the runway.
</p>

<h4>Winch</h4>

<p>It would be relatively unusual to winch launch the ASG29 <i>at all</i> as it is an expensive aircraft, and even more
unlikely to carry water ballast during a winch launch. The problem is the relatively high risk of a launch failure, when the 
ballast would make the ASG29 more difficult to handle and you have zero chance of dumping the ballast before landing.
</p>

<p>The X-Plane default of 25% ballast is probably the maximum reasonable for a winch launch in the ASG29.
</p>

<p>Flap setting <b>4/A</b> or <b>5/T</b> should be used for a winch launch.
</p>

<h4>Aerotow</h4>

<p>Full ballast can be safely carried on an aerotow launch although the glider will be considerably more 
    difficult to control than without ballast, with less aileron control and
    a ground loop more likely.</p>
    
<p>If the launch is aborted then the glider is far more likely to pitch onto its nose during braking, as the ballast is carried
    well above the point of braking friction and also the center-of-mass of the glider is moved forward as a result of carrying
    ballast.
</p>

<p>Flap setting <b>4/A</b> should be used for Aerotow launch.
