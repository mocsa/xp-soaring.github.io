<h1>Arrival Height</h1>


<h3 id="arrival_height">Arrival height / final glide calculation</h3>

<p><b>The information from the GPSNav is sent to the computer vario which will continuously calulate an expected
    arrival height
    above the next waypoint</b>. The computer vario above is saying you will arrive 1292 feet BELOW the intended waypoint.
    When you have height in hand the reading will have '+' in front of it. Note that the +/- figures are
    <b>above the ground</b> at that waypoint and the default units are feet unless you've changed that in
    your <a href="#user_settings">user settings</a>.
</p>
<p>The GPSNav is at heart a relatively simple GPS-based navigation instrument guiding you along a stored flightplan.
    In contrast the computer vario is doing a very complex calculation taking into account the all-up-weight of the
    glider (i.e. ballast carried), the wind speed, the glide performance of the ASK21, the pilot's chosen
    Maccready setting, the current altitude of the glider and the elevation of the waypoint in order to calculate the
    expected height the glider will be at when it finally arrives at that waypoint, which could be 30+ miles away.
</p>
<p>The calculation from the computer vario is <i>not</i> a guarantee - it doesn't know what lift and sink you'll fly
    through to get there, just like you.  But it's saying if you fly at the speed indicated on the STF needle <i>and</i>
    you fly though a reasonable balance of lift and sink, the calculation will be pretty close.  With experience
    you learn how much safety margin to add (or subtract!) from the calculation to avoid ending up in the dirt and
    winning the competition.
</p>
<p>Remember the <b>Maccready setting</b> is telling the computer vario how fast you intend to fly (indirectly by
    saying how strong you think the thermals will be). So if you turn this UP your arrival height will go DOWN, and
    vice versa. In other words if your arrival height at the waypoint is below what you'd like it to be, you
    have the option of turning the Maccready setting down and hence flying more conservatively with a happy
    effect on your predicted arrival height.
</p>
<p>This arrival height is <i>everything</i> during your final glide back to your home airport. From maybe 30 miles away
    you may climb high enough to have a positive arrival height above your home airfield, at which point you can set sail
    for home and worry a lot less about finding the next thermal.  It is normal to dolphin a fair bit through
    thermals on the way home so you improve a bit on the calculation, and then maybe 10 miles out you can crank up
    the Maccready until the arrival height is only a couple of hundred feet and storm home.
