Welcome to Day 6 of the Krasnoff County Regionals!
</strong></font></p>

<p>Today's task is a 350km triangle, with legs of 130, 115 and 105 km.</p>

<p>Conditions are improving, and are expected to be better tomorrow.
The day is quite reasonable, with average 3.5 knot thermals to 12:30, then 4-5 knots
from 13:00, the good lift lasting until 16:00 and the day weakening from then on.
Sea air could come in as far as the first turnpoint, but the rest of the task should
be unaffected.  Winds are light.
</p>

<p>To begin, 'Hunt' for a thermal, and select 'Start Task' at the
top of a climb when you're ready to go. There is more help
and a detailed discussion of the simulator in <a href="k_help.html">the help file</a>.</p>
