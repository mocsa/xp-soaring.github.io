<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>We want the launching to be realistic - this includes the speed and stall behaviour during the launch, 
    as well as the behaviour of the instruments, such as the yawstring.

<h2>Aerotow launches</h2>

</div>
<p>X-Plane includes aerotow for gliders in the stock product. It gets you in the air behind an AI tow-plane
    but has limitations - the climb rate is unrealistically fast (by a factor of 4) and the tow-rope animation
    is very basic.
</p>

<h2>Winch launches</h2>

</div>
<p>X-Plane includes winch launch for gliders in the stock product. I haven't tested this yet.
</p>

<h2>Slew mode</h2>

<p>... more coming soon...
