<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>We want to be able to define a task with waypoints, a start time, and set weather, ideally in a
    secure way.
</p>
<p>Then sim pilots in real-time, or individually, can fly those tasks and record completion times that
    are comparable.
</p>

<p><a href="http://snagardev.weebly.com/">Mission-X</a> is a plugin for X-Plane than supports the creation
    of scripted missions. I'm not aware of it being used for soaring tasks but it is worth a look.
</p>

<p>Tasks should be stored in the <a href="x-plane_fms_format.html">X-Plane FMS format</a>

<h2>Loading waypoints into Little Navmap</h2>

<p>Soaring waypoint lists can be converted into comma-separated '.csv' format and loaded into
Little Navmap. The Little Navmap
<a href="https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavmap/release/2.2/en/USERPOINT.html">
    manual</a> describes the process and required format of the csv file.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, for soaring waypoints, the simplest list of columns for the CSV file
would be:</p>
<pre>
"Pin",,&lt;ident&gt;,&lt;lat&gt;,&lt;lon&gt;,&lt;alt&gt;,,,&lt;description&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note this list includes 3 blank columns (will be explained later).</p>

<p>"Pin" tells Little Navmap to use a pin symbol for the waypoint.  The manual lists alternatives such as "POI".
</p>
<p><tt>ident</tt> should be a 6-character-max string identifying the waypoint, <b>without spaces</b>.
</p>
<p><tt>lat, lon, alt</tt> are the position of the waypoint in decimal degrees and feet.</p>
<p><tt>description</tt> is free text describing the waypoint, which most usefully can be the name followed
by a location description.</p>

<p>For example, here is the line refering to the Ripon Cathedral turnpoint:
</p>
<pre>
Pin,,Ripon,54.1350833,-1.5206167,102,,,Ripon - Cathedral Tower
</pre>
<p>The Little Navmap  omitted columns (e.g. between "Pin" and "Ripon" above) are name, magnetic offset and user tags
respectively. The reason to omit the 'name' is that it clutters the map.

<p>All X-Plane aircrafts have an FMC (visible or not) into which your can upload an FMS plan. For example the Cessna 172 has a GPS430 with very primitive capabilities, but in the back ground there is an FMC that can direct the GPS430.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Define a key referring to FMS/key_load (I use the backslash key "\").</li>
    <li>Create the flight plan and save it as .fms file.</li>
    <li>Copy the .fms file to &lt;X-Plane&nbsp;install&nbsp;folder&gt;/Output/FMS&nbsp;plans/.</li>
    <li>Start X-Plane and Cessna 172 and locate the plane on the starting airport of your flight plan.</li>
    <li>Hit key "\" and select the flight plan and load.</li>
    <li>First waypoint will show on the GPS430.</li>
    <li>Take off with runway heading set until 400 to 1,000 ft AGL.</li>
    <li>Switch CDI to GPS mode, activate LOC and activate the autopilot to fly the course.</li>
</ol>
