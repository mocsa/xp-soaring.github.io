<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>We want to be able to define a task with waypoints, a start time, and set weather, ideally in a
    secure way.
</p>
<p>Then sim pilots in real-time, or individually, can fly those tasks and record completion times that
    are comparable.
</p>

<p><a href="http://snagardev.weebly.com/">Mission-X</a> is a plugin for X-Plane than supports the creation
    of scripted missions. I'm not aware of it being used for soaring tasks but it is worth a look.
</p>

<p>Tasks should be stored in the <a href="x-plane_fms_format.html">X-Plane FMS format</a>
</p>

<p><a href="https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html">Little Navmap</a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) is a good 
    flight planning tool.

<p>All X-Plane aircrafts have an FMC (visible or not) into which your can upload an FMS plan. For example the Cessna 172 has a GPS430 with very primitive capabilities, but in the back ground there is an FMC that can direct the GPS430.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Define a key referring to FMS/key_load (I use the backslash key "\").</li>
    <li>Create the flight plan and save it as .fms file.</li>
    <li>Copy the .fms file to &lt;X-Plane&nbsp;install&nbsp;folder&gt;/Output/FMS&nbsp;plans/.</li>
    <li>Start X-Plane and Cessna 172 and locate the plane on the starting airport of your flight plan.</li>
    <li>Hit key "\" and select the flight plan and load.</li>
    <li>First waypoint will show on the GPS430.</li>
    <li>Take off with runway heading set until 400 to 1,000 ft AGL.</li>
    <li>Switch CDI to GPS mode, activate LOC and activate the autopilot to fly the course.</li>
</ol>

<p>...more coming soon...
