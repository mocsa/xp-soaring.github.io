<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>We want to be able to define a task with waypoints, a start time, and set weather, ideally in a
    secure way.
</p>
<p>Then sim pilots in real-time, or individually, can fly those tasks and record completion times that
    are comparable.
</p>

<p><a href="http://snagardev.weebly.com/">Mission-X</a> is a plugin for X-Plane than supports the creation
    of scripted missions. I'm not aware of it being used for soaring tasks but it is worth a look.
</p>

<p>...more coming soon...
