</div>

<p>The central large display on the panel provides a variety of navigation information taking into
    account the speeds the pilot is flying and the ballast being carried. This includes directional
    pointers, distance to go, and predicted arrival height for the <i>current</i> and <i>next</i>
    waypoints.
</p>

<h4>The control buttons</h4>

<p>Across the top of the Navpanel are four buttons:
</p>

<div class="center">
    <img src="images/instruments/navpanel_buttons.png"/>
</div>

<ol>
<li><b>PAGE:</b> will cycle through the multiple pages of information on the Navpanel, i.e.
    <i>Nav</i>, <i>Task</i>, <i>multiple checklists</i>. It is normal to fly with the 'Nav'
    page displayed as illustrated above.
</li>
<li><b>LOAD:</b> launch the stock X-Plane flightplan load screen to open a .FMS file used
     to define a <a href="../../../tasks/index.html">soaring task</a>.
</li>
<li><b>WP-:</b> when a task is loaded this will update the Navpanel to use the <i>previous</i>
    waypoint in the task.
</li>
<li><b>WP+:</b> as above but to select the <i>next</i> waypoint in the task.
</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="task">Loading a task</h4>

<p>You can create a soaring task using external tools, such as 
<a href="https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html">Little navmap</a> or
<a href="https://www.tasoftware.co.uk/">Plan-G</a>. This will produce a .FMS file with the selected
waypoints which you store in your <tt>&lt;X-Plane base&gt;/Output/FMS&nbsp;plans</tt> directory. (Here is
an <a href="1N7-Slatington.fms">example</a> starting at 1N7 Blairstown USA)
</p>
<p>The Navpanel ignores the altitudes in the .FMS file, and uses ground elevations provided
by X-Plane instead.
</p>

<p>Click the Navpanel <b>LOAD</b> button to select your task (.FMS) file and load it into the Navpanel.
</p>

<p>When a task is loaded, the Navpanel will switch to the 'Task' page below, giving the current selected
waypoint in yellow at the top of the page, and each waypoint name (e.g. "1N7"), the 'leg' distance 
from there to the next waypoint, and the elevation of the waypoint.
</p>
<p>With no .FMS file loaded, the 'Task' page will simple show the "B21 NAVPANEL" graphic on the left.
</p>

<div class="center">
        <img src="images/instruments/navpanel_no_task.png"/>
        <img src="images/instruments/navpanel_task.png"/>
    </div>
    

<h4 id="nav">Navigation</h4>

<p>This is the default page at startup, and should be the page viewed while soaring. It provides
essential soaring navigation information while on a task, i.e. the direction and distance to go
to the next <i>two</i> waypoints, and the predicted arrival heights when you get there, taking into
account the ballast you are carrying, the speeds you are expected to fly at, your current altitude, the
elevation of each waypoint and the current wind. The Navpanel will <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">NOT</span>
take into account any high obstructions between you and your destination.
</p>

<p>Note your default units for altitude (feet / meters) , distance (miles / kilometers) and speeds (knots / kilometers per hour) 
can be changed in 
the <a href="installation.html#user_settings">USER_SETTINGS</a> file.
</p>

<div class="center">
    <img src="images/instruments/navpanel.png"/>
</div>

<p>The information displayed on the "Nav" page, using the example above, is:
</p>

    <td><h4>Waypoint number/name</h4>
        <image src="images/instruments/navpanel_wp.png"/></td>
    <td>The waypoint number out of the total waypoints in the task (i.e. "1" of "5"). The waypoint name (i.e. "1N7").

    <td>Your predicted height AGL (above ground level) at the waypoint. <b>This simple number is the main point of the

        at the current ballast load assuming you are
        flying at the optimal speed (see <a href="#speed-to-fly">speed to fly<a>) 
            for your <a href="#maccready">Maccready setting</a>. When on <b>final glide</b> to your destination, possibly

        the direction of the

        a slightly offset tailwind of 14 knots. In general
        the wind will reduce with altitude but the arrival height calculations always assume the
        <i>current wind</i>. So a final glide with a tailwind will be slightly optimistically calculated (as the
        tailwind reduces as you get lower) and a final glide into a headwind will actually be slightly better than
        you expect for the same reason. The units

        quickly you will learn this exactly equates to <i>how fast you want to fly</i>. If you turn <i>up</i> the
        dial the speed-to-fly vario will beep at you to fly <i>faster</i>, and the predicted arrival height will get

<h4 id="maccready">The Maccready setting</h4>

<div class="center">
    <img src="images/instruments/navpanel_maccready.png"/>
</div>

    <p>The knob labelled "Mc" in the picture above is used to dial-in a <b>Maccready Setting</b>. This can be
        interpreted different ways but the simplest is as the <b>expected strength of your next climb</b>. I.e. the
        setting has the same units as your vario setting, e.g Knots, and the setting is displayed in the two digits the
        left side of the Navpanel adjacent to the Maccready Knob. Adjusting the setting will affect the 
        <a href="#speed-to-fly">speed</a> the
        computer vario recommends you fly, and the <a href="#arrival_height">arrival height</a>
         predicted at your next waypoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        The computer vario will do many calculations based on how fast you are intending to fly, a simple example
        being your arrival height at a future waypoint will depend on your sink rate at your planned cruising speed
        with this being related by the glider <a href="../../dev/polar.html">polar</a>. This may sound a circular
        explanation but the vario itself (in Speed-to-Fly mode) will be <i>telling</i> you how fast to fly and the vario
        assumes reasonably you will be mostly following that guidance. But it uses the <i>pilot input</i> for the
        expected strength of thermals to calibrate it's recommended speed-to-fly.
    </p>
    <p>The net of all this is the Maccready
        Setting is the pilot's one communication with the computer vario which then adjusts everything else. The pilot
        learns pretty quickly that in still air a Maccready setting of, say, 3 knots will give a recommended speed of say
        70 knots, or maybe a 4 knot Maccready will recommend 80 knots airspeed.  A perfectly normal use of the
        Maccready setting is for the pilot, with years of experience of how fast they should fly in different
        weather conditions, to turn the Maccready UP when they want to fly a bit faster or DOWN when they feel they
        should be cautious. The computer vario will still do all the calculation trickery to continuously adjust the speed
        appropriately in any lift or sink. (Note the actual speeds in a heavily ballasted racing glider like the
        ASW27 will be <i>much</i> higher)
    </p>
    <p>The Maccready Setting has a special use on <b>final glide</b> (see <a href="#arrival_height">below</a>). It is
        normal for the pilot to fly the course with an optimal cross-country Maccready Setting for the weather,
        say 3.5 knots, and at some point the arrival height for the finish will become positive (happy news). At this
        point the pilot is likely to set off for the finish but may still dolphin in thermals and gain a bit of energy
        on the way so the predicted arrival height continues to improve.  At this point the pilot can turn UP the
        Maccready until that reduces the arrival height to a small margin above the airfield, and then
        follow the Speed-to-Fly much faster to the finish. The extra speed actually provides a built-in safety margin
        but only the pilot experience can assess the expected conditions on the way home to judge accurately the risk of
        landing out.
    </p>

    <h4 id="speed-to-fly">Speed to Fly</h4>
    <p>
        In Speed-to-Fly
        mode the variometer behaves <i>like</i> a normal variometer and appears to be indicating lift and sink in
        a fairly coherent manner, but in fact the lift and sink indications have been fundamentally transformed into
        a closely related concept (in soaring) that you should SPEED UP or SLOW DOWN. The general optimal
        practice in soaring is that you SPEED UP IN SINK and SLOW DOWN IN LIFT, and the Speed-to-Fly vario computes
        the <i>optimum</i> speed to fly given the current lift or sink, compares that to your current speed, and moves
        the needle and beeps or buuuurps directly according to how much you should speed up or slow down.
    </p>
    <p>This is more
        complicated to explain than to use in practice - the net effect is a vario that beeps at you to slow down and
        buuuuuurps at you to speed up, which is kind of what any electronic vario is doing although the STF vario does all
        this relative to your current airspeed (and in fact how much water ballast you're carrying, which in the
        ASK21 is zero). The optimal speed for you to fly in <i>still air</i> varies a lot depending on the strength of
        the next climb you're hoping to get, and this provides the baseline around which the STF vario operates. So
        you tell the vario your <i>guess</i> of the strength of the next thermal by turning the knob for the
        <b>Maccready Setting</b> (labelled "Mc" in the picture above).
    </p>
    <p>This is simpler than it sounds - a typical setting might be 3 or 4 knots and you can
        dial that in and leave it for most of your flight, flying between thermals at the speed the STF vario directs you
        to. The Maccready setting ultimately becomes a kind of 'confidence' setting - if you're feeling courageous you turn
        the reading up and the STF will push you to fly faster, using up height at a scary rate but a strong climb will
        make all that worthwhile.
    </p>

<h3 id="arrival_height">Arrival height / final glide calculation</h3>

<p>The computer navpanel above is saying you will arrive 2114 feet <i>above</i> the current waypoint.
    When you have height in hand the reading will have '+' in front of it. Note that the +/- figures are
    <b>above the ground</b> at that waypoint and the default units are feet unless you've changed that in
    your <a href="installation.html#user_settings">User settings</a>.
</p>
<p>The Navpanel provides GPS-based navigation guiding you along a stored flightplan.
    The Navpanel is continuously doing a very complex calculation taking into account the all-up-weight of the
    glider (i.e. ballast carried), the wind speed, the glide performance of the ASG29 at that ballast level,
     the pilot's chosen
    Maccready setting, the current altitude of the glider and the elevation of the waypoint in order to calculate the
    expected height the glider will be at when it finally arrives at that waypoint, which could be 30+ miles away.
</p>
<p>The calculation from the Navpanel is <i>not</i> a guarantee - it doesn't know what lift and sink you'll fly
    through to get there, just like you.  But it's saying if you fly at the speed indicated on the STF needle <i>and</i>
    you fly though a reasonable balance of lift and sink, the calculation will be pretty close.  With experience
    you learn how much safety margin to add (or subtract!) from the calculation to avoid ending up in the dirt and
    winning the competition.
</p>
<p>Remember the <b>Maccready setting</b> is telling the computer vario how fast you intend to fly (indirectly by
    saying how strong you think the thermals will be). So if you turn this UP your arrival height will go DOWN, and
    vice versa. In other words if your arrival height at the waypoint is below what you'd like it to be, you
    have the option of turning the Maccready setting down and hence flying more conservatively with a happy
    effect on your predicted arrival height.
</p>
<p>This arrival height is <i>everything</i> during your final glide back to your home airport. From maybe 30 miles away
    you may climb high enough to have a positive arrival height above your home airfield, at which point you can set sail
    for home and worry a lot less about finding the next thermal.  It is normal to dolphin a fair bit through
    thermals on the way home so you improve a bit on the calculation, and then maybe 10 miles out you can crank up
    the Maccready until the arrival height is only a couple of hundred feet and storm home.
</p>

<p>A key point is towards the end of a flight you tend to use the Maccready Setting / Arrival Height in <i>reverse</i>
    i.e. you're watching the arrival height increase from negative to positive (at which point you feel like you are
    nearly home, even though you could be 50Km+ away) and from then on you may dolphin fly to extract some energy
    from the lift you fly through but gradually crank up the Maccready setting so the predicted arrival height
    reduces again to a value that is good enough (say a few hundred feet) but not ridiculously conservative.
</p>

<h3>Checklists</h3>
<div class="center">
        <img src="images/instruments/navpanel_checklist.png"/>
    </div>
<p>There are a few checklists after the <i>Nav</i> and <i>Task</i> pages, e.g. Flaps, Ballast and Landing and Launch
checklists.  The sequence is intentionally set such that the final checklist page is "Launch" so one press of the
"Page" button will bring you back to the "Nav" page which is suitable for the entire flight.
