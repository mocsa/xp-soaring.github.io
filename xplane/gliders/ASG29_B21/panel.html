                    will kill your glide performance).</p>
                <p>
                <p>As a simple approximation, the ASG29 will manage up to 50:1 glide ratio with the spoilers closed,
                    and more like 6:1 with gerar down, Landing flap and the spoilers fully open. 
                    A 'good' final approach to landing
                    will have the spoilers 50% open, as this gives you the most flexibility in increasing or reducing
                    the glide. It is generally accepted in gliding that the landing is a one-shot attempt.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Important:</b> an analog axis on your joystick should be set to control the spoilers (in X-Plane called
                <b>Speedbrakes</b>). Keen soaring pilots will use the <i>throttle axis</i>, with a backward pull opening the
                brakes.<br/>
                <b>Also Important: </b> when the spoilers are opened between 75% and 100%, the wheel brake is linearly operated.

            </p>
            <p>The switch on the panel (labelled <b>6</b>) allows the pilot to choose whether they would like the 
                instrument to stay in Total Energy mode, Speed to Fly mode, or automatically toggle between the two as
                appropriate. In general Total Energy mode, which simply tells you how much the glider is
                climbing or sinking, is most suitable for thermalling (the TE compensation smoothes out the short-term
                effects of pilot control inputs). The Speed to Fly mode is most suitable for cruising between thermals and
                especially the final glide - the indications of lift and sink are similar but actually telling you how much to slow down
                or speed up, i.e. if you are already flying at exactly the right speed the vario will read zero.
            </p>
            <p>The Computer Vario will provide an <b>audio indication</b> of the lift and sink, i.e. a rising interrupted
                tone for lift and a continuous sinking tone for sink. For competitive flying this audio information
                 is essential but for noobies and those recording video, it can be annoying and the volume can be
                 turned down with the volume control knob (<b>10</b>).

                loading on the elevator which controls the glider speed at a neutral joystick position. Trim forward
                will result in a fast 'hands-off' gliding speed, while trim back will result in a slower speed, e.g. for
                more relaxed thermalling.

            <td><p><b>Netto Vario</b>.
                The panel top-left smaller (57mm) variometer reads the <b>Netto</b> sink/climb rate. This is really simple in concept:
                    the sink rate of the glider in <i>still air</i> at the current airspeed is subtracted from the total energy
                    reading shown on the Winter Vario described above. If you watch the two varios carefully in flight you'll see
                    they appear to move in tandem, with the Netto reading just offset upwards. This amount of offset of the Netto
                    needle varies with the speed of the aircraft to match the way the 'still air' sink rate of the aircraft varies
                    with airspeed.
                </p>
                <p>The end result is the Netto Vario is showing you the sink rate of the <i>air through which the
                    aircraft is flying</i> (as the natural sink of the glider has been deducted). In X-Plane you can witness
                    this by choosing a flight in 'clear' weather and once you're off tow the needle will read pretty
                    close to zero throughout your flight in spite of you flying at a variety of speeds.
                </p>
                <p>Note the simulated
                    instrument doesn't 'cheat' by reading vertical air movement from X-Plane - it does the same calculation as
                    is built into the real instrument using airspeed and altimeter climb/descent rates so it is fairly accurate but
                    will deviate in certain circumstances such as a low-G push-over just like the real instrument. At very fast or
                    very slow airspeeds the aircraft 'polar' calculation calibrated into the instrument can't hope to be perfectly
                    accurate so the netto reading will drift in these corners of the flight envelope, again like the real thing.

                The knob labelled "Mc" in the picture above is used to dial-in a <b>Maccready Setting</b>. This can be
                    interpreted different ways but the simplest is as the <b>expected strength of your next climb</b>. I.e. the
                    setting has the same units as your vario setting, e.g Knots, and the setting is displayed in the two digits at
                    3 o'clock in the picture above in which it is the "0.0" above the 'STF' graphic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The computer vario will do many calculations based on how fast you are intending to fly, a simple example
                    being your arrival height at a future waypoint will depend on your sink rate at your planned cruising speed
                    with this being related by the glider <a href="../../dev/polar.html">polar</a>. This may sound a circular
                    explanation but the vario itself (in Speed-to-Fly mode) will be <i>telling</i> you how fast to fly and the vario
                    assumes reasonably you will be mostly following that guidance. But it uses the <i>pilot input</i> for the
                    expected strength of thermals to calibrate it's recommended speed-to-fly.
                </p>
                <p>The net of all this is the Maccready
                    Setting is the pilot's one communication with the computer vario which then adjusts everything else. The pilot
                    learns pretty quickly that in still air a Maccready setting of, say, 3 knots will give a recommended speed of say
                    70 knots, or maybe a 4 knot Maccready will recommend 80 knots airspeed.  A perfectly normal use of the
                    Maccready setting is for the pilot, with years of experience of how fast they should fly in different
                    weather conditions, to turn the Maccready UP when they want to fly a bit faster or DOWN when they feel they
                    should be cautious. The computer vario will still do all the calculation trickery to continuously adjust the speed
                    appropriately in any lift or sink. (Note the actual speeds in a heavily ballasted racing glider like the
                    ASW27 will be <i>much</i> higher)
                </p>
                <p>The Maccready Setting has a special use on <b>final glide</b> (see <a href="#arrival_height">below</a>). It is
                    normal for the pilot to fly the course with an optimal cross-country Maccready Setting for the weather,
                    say 3.5 knots, and at some point the arrival height for the finish will become positive (happy news). At this
                    point the pilot is likely to set off for the finish but may still dolphin in thermals and gain a bit of energy
                    on the way so the predicted arrival height continues to improve.  At this point the pilot can turn UP the
                    Maccready until that reduces the arrival height to a small margin above the airfield, and then
                    follow the Speed-to-Fly much faster to the finish. The extra speed actually provides a built-in safety margin
                    but only the pilot experience can assess the expected conditions on the way home to judge accurately the risk of
                    landing out.
                </p>
            <p>If you are currently clueless (welcome to gliding, by the way) just dial in a value of 4 knots, or 2 meters 
                per second, and that will provide a reasonable medium. With experience you will learn to increase the figure
                when you're feeling confident and want to fly faster, or you're on the final glide and have lots of height in
                hand. On the other hand when you're struggling even to stay aloft, you'll dump all the ballast and reduce this
                to zero until things improve.
