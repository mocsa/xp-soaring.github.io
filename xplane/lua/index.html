<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Lua is a popular scripting language designed to extend platforms written in some other language,
    particularly C/C++ that, usefully, X-Plane is written in. In answer to the question <i>"can I do this..."</i>
    in X-Plane, the answer is <i>"yes"</i>.
    If Laminar haven't already implemented it then you can add that capability yourself via X-Plane's
    support for 'plugins', and those are most straightforwardly produced in Lua. X-Plane has a comprehensive
    programming interface (SDK API) available in the more complex and detailed 'C/C++' programming language and the Lua
    support in X-Plane is effectively a bridge from that simpler language to this API.
</p>
<p>Lua plugins have the advantage of being 'operating system' agnostic, i.e. plugins developed in Lua
    typically don't care whether X-Plane is running on Windows, Linux or a Mac.
</p>

<h2>xlua vs. FlyWithLua vs. SASL</h2>
<p>An easy point of confusion is that there are <i>three</i> completely independent implementations of
    Lua as an X-Plane plugin scripting framework. They all exist for the same reason but the basic
    differences are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="xlua_info.html">
        <b>xlua</b>
        </a> is developed (nominally for internal use) by Laminar Research (who make X-Plane). So you can write a
        simple xLua script
        with reasonable confidence. The fundamental capability <i>required</i> of any plugin support is to read
        'datarefs' from the core sim (like the current altitude) and issue 'commands' or publish new 'datarefs'
        that causes a change to some aspect of your flight (e.g. giving a 'gear up' warning or moving a
        needle on an instrument). xlua provides this capability and so is suitable for 80% of plugins. <i>But</i>
        xlua is by far the most limited of the three options (e.g. no sounds, filesystem, debugging). There is neglible
        documentation
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/335-help-me-i-have-a-problem-with-flywithlua/">
        <b>FlyWithLua</b>
        </a>
        has comprehensive support for the X-Plane API, and by using an add-on library can provide
        a way of natively accessing any methods in the X-Plane SDK API. The code is partly open-source and community
        support is available. Debugging is primarily based on writing your messages to the X-Plane log file. There
        doesn't seem to be a definitive FlyWithLua website where you can download the add-on, access its documentation,
        etc. The documentation is contained within the actual download
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.1-sim.com/"><b>SASL</b></a> also has comprehensive support for the X-Plane SDK API, and
        also available is a commercial version for payware add-on developers. Debugging support is well implemented, with
        a per-project in-sim debug window available to see your error messages.
    </li>
</ul>
