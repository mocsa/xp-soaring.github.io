<h1>IGC file format homepage</h1>

</p>

<p>I've written a few different programs for creating and analysing the IGC-format log files used
in soaring as the accepted transcript of the route of a flight, and this page collects reference
information helpful to developers.</p>

<p><b>As a plea</b>, if you <i>read</i> an IGC file into your software, just pick up the records
and fields meaningful to you and <b>ignore</b> records and fields you don't care about. If you
want but don't get a 'pilot date of birth' (this is an optional field in an IGC file, I kid you not) don't 
have your software crash... just continue with a default value. If you see a record in an
IGC file you don't recognise, just skip it. 99.999% of what needs to be done with an IGC file
comes from reading the timestamped 'B' tracklog records (time, lat, long, alt), everything else is pretty 
much irrelevant
overhead for most purposes. 'B' records can have additional <i>optional</i> values tagged on
the end (e.g. speed) so if you just need time, lat, long, alt please don't have your software
crash because the 'B' record is slightly longer than you expected, just read the fields you
want and ignore the rest of the line.
</p>

<p>In summary, the IGC file format is like every other 'GPS trail' file format, in that it
is basically a container for a series of plain-text time-stamped location records one-per-line giving: <br/>
<center><tt>&lt;time&gt;&nbsp;&lt;lat&gt;&nbsp;&lt;long&gt;&nbsp;&lt;alt&gt;&nbsp;</tt></center>
</p>
<p>To cut to the chase a real IGC file could be as below (although most software will require
additional header records):<br/>
<center><tt>B1101355206343N00006198WA0058700558</tt></center>
<center><tt>B1101455206259N00006295WA0059300556</tt></center>
<center><tt>B1101555206300N00006061WA0060300576</tt></center>
<center><tt>B1102055206337N00006201WA0062000586</tt></center>
<center><tt>B1102155206314N00005990WA0062200588</tt></center>
<center><tt>B1102255206417N00006098WA0063100596</tt></center>
</p>
<p>And to explain the basic record format, using commas to indicate the actual fields:</br>
<center><tt>B,110135,5206343N,00006198W,A,00587,00558</tt></center>
<tt>B</tt>: record type is a basic tracklog record<br/>
<tt>110135</tt>: &lt;time&gt; tracklog entry was recorded at 11:01:35 i.e. just after 11am<br/>
<tt>5206343N</tt>: &lt;lat&gt; i.e. 52 degrees 06.343 minutes North<br/>
<tt>00006198W</tt>: &lt;long&gt; i.e. 000 degrees 06.198 minutes West<br/>
<tt>A</tt>: &lt;alt valid flag&gt; confirming this record has a valid altitude value<br/>
<tt>00587</tt>: &lt;altitude from pressure sensor&gt;<br/>
<tt>00558</tt>: &lt;altitude from GPS&gt;<br/>
</p>

<p>So if we call the 'B' record a 'trackpoint' record, you can see an IGC file without any
would be
fairly pointless (that's a pun, by the way). However, IGC files
can contain quite a few other record types, each indicated by a unique first letter 
and similarly terminated by a newline. Nearly all of the additional records are placed at
the beginning of the IGC file, recording the DATE the trackpoints were created (this is
important as the B records only contain the TIME) and also the name of the user, registration
of the aircraft involved, type of logger used, other general stuff of that nature. NONE of these
records actually care about the <i>content</i>, e.g. what is written for the type of the logger,
so if that record is irrelevant for your requirement the usual approach is to populate the
record with something generic, rather than omit the record.
</p>

<p>So an IGC file that pretty much all display software would be happy with could be:<br/>
<tt>
AXXX<font color=green> sim_logger v2.31</font><br/>

<p>You would need to check the <a href="igc_format_2008.html">spec</a> to understand the
meaning of each of these header records, but the important thing to know is that the green
stuff is whatever you want it to be. Software reading the file may or may not display or discard
the HFGIDGLIDERID (the 7th record i this example), but if your usage doesn't 
actually have a glider id then set it to XX or
anything else you don't care about...
</p>

<p>In terms of priority, assuming you're coming to this page because you want to understand
the IGC file format, you see from above you can get an effective tracklog file quickly with
the header records plus a string of 'B' trackpoint records. Be prepared for most software to
throw away most of your carefully considered header information, but you want to include it
for other shite software out there which crashes if the file doesn't have e.g. a
HFGIDGLIDERID: record. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Task (Course or Route) definition:</b> In addition to the critical <a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_B">B record</a>,
the IGC file format can contain a <i>task</i> (i.e. route or course) definition using
a similar <a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_C">C record</a>, so your IGC file can contain
both the actual trail followed (in the B records) and the originally intended 'route'. This is
particularly suitable for aviation as it is normal to declare your major waypoints in a flight plan
before you take off. 
</li>
<li><b>Additional fields on the tracklog B record</b> can be defined with the header
<a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_I">I record</a>. So you are not limited
to the default time, lat, long, alt set of fields. For example you could easily have your
tracklog records be time, lat, long, alt, speed, heading. The defined additional fields
are documented in <a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_7">para 7</a> of the spec. In practice these
fields are almost <i>always ignored</i> by tracklog display software so actually they
can be conveniently used for your purposes if necessary, e.g. if you wanted to store aircraft
bank in a field you would make up your own code or hijack an existing one.
</li>
<li><b>Comment records:</b> Finally a useful catch-all if you want to store your own proprietry 
information in the IGC file is the comment or 
<a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_L">L record</a>. Many software developers (including me)
use L records
to embed their own data in the file. In my case for flight simulator use I can record the
<i>real</i> PC date and time the file was saved, while the main IGC date and timestamps actually
record date/time in the <i>simulator</i>. If you do use the L record, use a reasonably
unique string immediately after the 'L' so your records don't confuse other software that might
also be trying to pick out data from their own comments. E.g. here's a comment from the
log files I generate in my Flight Simulator logger (my comments use '<tt>L FSX</tt>'):<br/>
<center><tt>L FSX user PC time            2011-10-01_0933</tt></center>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I re-structured the FAI IGC 'Appendix 1' document section detailing the file format into
an HTML file with cross-referencing links within it, so that references to (for example) the crucial
<a href="igc_format_2008.html#link_B">B record</a> can be linked to the right part of the specification.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="igc_format_2008.html">IGC file format documentation in HTML with handy cross-reference links</a>.
 I started with the 'Appendix 1' part of the PDF IGC specification and added all the cross-reference links. 
 It took ages but
 I think the document is now more usable.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss.pdf">Technical Specification for 
IGC-Approved GNSS Flight Recorders</a>. The definitive document
from the FAI. The HTML document linked above is a taken from Appendix 1. The FAI 
unfortunately rename links on their site at frequent intervals so links-in are almost
impossible to rely on. If you can't find the file on the FAI site,
<a href="tech_spec_gnss.pdf">use this copy on my site</a> which I promise not to move around.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=89686">IGC files can be directly uploaded
to everytrail.com</a>. This is a bit of an aside but damn fine, in my view.
</li>
<li><a href="sample_igc_file.txt">Here is a sample real IGC file</a> (from an LX logger) which includes the engine
firing up during the flight (see the 'engine noise level' in the last three characters of each 'B record' from
12:53:28 UTC).
