<h1>IGC FILE FORMAT REFERENCE AND DEVELOPERS' GUIDE - Ian Forster-Lewis</h1>

<p>These are notes created for my personal use to try and make the FAI documentation more useful to me as a logger
developer. For a comprehensive example IGC file see <a href="complex_example_lxn.igc">this LXN-produced real IGC file</a>.
</p>

<p>Web links in the <a href="https://fai.org">FIA</a> change every time they hire a new webdev, so a copy of the
<a href="igc_fr_specification_with_al8_2023-2-1_0.pdf">FAI IGC Specification 2023 is hosted here</a>.
</p>

<p>This web-linked html version is for the IGC spec 2008, but it hasn't changed much. I have kept the FAI chapter/section numbers but added to some of the sections.</p>

<h2><a name="link_preface"></a>Preface: ANNOTATED SAMPLE</h2>

<p>Here's a 'walk-through' of a valid IGC file, this is not in the original FAI document.
 'Space' characters have been inserted for legibility, if you
want to cut-and-paste this file as a starting point for your development, you could use the version of the same
file in <a href="#link_9">section 9</a> without the inserted spaces. Free text is in italics meaning you can enter pretty much anything, otherwise the exact number
of characters must match the example. Each 'record' in an IGC file fits on a single line and the first few characters
determine the record <i>type</i>.  I have linked those initial chars in the sample below to the corresponding
section of the specification. </p>

    all analysis programs look at (you'd be surprised how much of this 'H' stuff they simply throw away...).
    So with the <a href="#link_I">I&nbsp;record</a> you can include, say, engine noise level, with every
    fix point. The sample here says engine noise level (<a href="#link_ENL">ENL</a>) will be

<h2><a name="link_1"></a>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><b><a name="link_1.1"></a>1.1 Background, and IGC file production.</b> The IGC Data File Standard was
initially developed by a group
consisting of representatives of IGC, glider FR manufacturers and a number of independent software developers
mainly concerned with flight data analysis programs. After discussion and development during 1993 and 1994 it
was initially defined in December 1994 and became part of official IGC/FAI documents after approval by IGC
in March 1995. It has been refined and developed afterwards, through regular amendments. It provides a
common world standard data format for the verification of badge, record, and competition flights to FAI/IGC
criteria. The Standard may also be used by other FAI sports and activities.</p>
<p><a name="link_1.1.1"></a><b>1.1.1</b> Production of Flight Data File. It must be possible to produce a
separate and complete IGC flight
data file for each flight including all record types (<a href="#link_2.2">para 2.2</a> following)
relevant to the flight such as header
records, flight declaration, etc. Two ways of achieving this are by continuous recording of fixes between
the times that the FR was switched on and off, or, for FRs that have a "standby" state on switch-on, only
recording fixes after pre-set movement and pressure-change thresholds are exceeded (ceasing recording
when changes are below the thresholds, but see <a href="#link_1.1.1.2">1.1.1.2</a> on short periods without external power).(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al3.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL3</small></a>)
<p><a name="link_1.1.1.1"></a>1.1.1.1 Thresholds for starting and stopping recording, also Power-on Protocol for creating new IGC
files. The following thresholds before fixes are recorded have been found suitable in the past: lat/long
change, 10-15 km/hr; pressure altitude change, 1 metre per second for 5 seconds. Pre-takeoff and
after-landing baselines of at least 20 fixes must be provided. For the pre-takeoff baseline, a small
memory circuit can be used that continuously stores the appropriate number of previous fixes and,
when movement is detected, puts them into the flight data record. After landing, this can be achieved
by a time delay before stopping the recording of fixes. This condition may also apply to a period in
wave or ridge lift with little or no vertical or horizontal movement. Therefore, a new IGC file must not
be started while external power is still connected and the recorder is still switched on, even when no
movement is being detected and no fixes are being recorded. Note that this "power-on protocol" is also
needed for barograph calibrations so that a new file is not produced while the calibrator is making small
adjustments to the pressure at each level of the calibration. A new IGC file is produced under the
"Power-off Protocol" that is described under <a href="#link_1.1.1.2">1.1.1.2</a> below.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al5.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL5</small></a>), modified by (<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al9.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL9</small></a>)
<p><a name="link_1.1.1.2"></a>1.1.1.2 Loss of external power for short periods - Power-off Protocol for creating new IGC files. To
allow for events such as changing or switching batteries in flight, a period of 5 minutes with no external
power shall be allowed to elapse before a new Flight Data File is created on powering up again. After
this period has elapsed a new IGC file must be produced, so that if several flights are made on one day,
each has a complete IGC data file of its own.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al3.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL3</small></a>)
<p><a name="link_1.1.1.3"></a>1.1.1.3 Data transfer to a PC. If the data for several flights is held in the FR memory, it must be
ensured that when the data is transferred, all record types in IGC files that are subsequent to the first
file are those relevant to each subsequent individual flight. If any record types are changed between
flights (such as declaration, pilot name, etc.) the changes must be included in the subsequent (but not
previous) flight data files.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al3.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL3</small></a>)
<p><a name="link_1.1.1.4"></a>1.1.1.4 Recorders operating on internal power. Some recorders are designed so that all of their
functions are available on internal power. For these recorders, external power is used for charging and
as a backup for long flights. When operating on internal power it must be ensured that under flight
conditions of little horizontal or vertical movement (such as in ridge or wave flying), the IGC file
continues be able to record data and is not ended while flight continues. The IGC file shall be ended
after one of the following three conditions: (1) if no horizontal or vertical movement has been detected
for 10 minutes (thresholds as in <a href="#link_1.1.1.1">1.1.1.1</a> above); (2) after the recorder is switched off by deliberate
action, or; (3) if the recorder is still powered after the flight, when the user establishes a connection for
purposes of downloading from the recorder.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al10.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL10</small></a>)
<p><b><a name="link_1.2"></a>1.2 REVISION CONTROL.</b> The IGC flight data file format is revised through the normal amendment
process for this document. See amendment procedures and list of amendment on page (i).
</p>
<h2><a name="link_2"></a>2. GENERAL</h2>
<p><b><a name="link_2.1"></a>2.1 FILE STRUCTURE.</b> An IGC-format file consists of lines of characters, each line giving a set of data
such as for a GNSS fix. Each line starts with an upper-case letter denoting one of the Record types listed in
para 2.2., and ends with CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed). Each line is limited to 76 characters in length,
excluding the CRLF which is hidden and does not appear in text form. Some Record types take up only
one line, some such as task and header take up several lines. For instance, the task/declaration (C) Record
includes a line for each Waypoint, and the Header (H) Record includes separate lines for GNSS FR type,
pilot name, glider identification, etc. The order of Record types within an IGC file is given in para 2.3.
Some Record types occur only in only one place in the file (single instance Records), others such as fixes
re-occur as time progresses (multiple instance Records). Only characters listed as valid in para 6 shall be
used in the file. If others such as accented characters (acutes, hatcheks, umlauts, etc) in names of airfields
and turn points, are used in a manufacturer's proprietary (original) file format, such characters shall be
converted to a valid character as part of the conversion to the IGC format. This is so that analysis programs
designed for the IGC format do not have to recognise non-standard characters.</p>
<p><b><a name="link_2.2"></a>2.2 RECORD TYPES.</b> The Record types are prefixed by upper case letters as follows:</p>
<pre>
IGC DATA FILE FORMAT - RECORD TYPE IDENTIFICATION LETTERS
A - FR manufacturer and identification
B - Fix
C - Task/declaration
D - Differential GPS
E - Event
F - Constellation
G - Security
H - File header
I - List of extension data included at end of each fix <a href="#link_B">B record</a>
J - List of data included in each extension (K) Record
K - Extension data
L - Logbook/comments
M, N, etc. - Spare
</pre>
<p><b><a name="link_2.3"></a>2.3 RECORD ORDER.</b> The FR I/D (A) Record is always the first in the file and the last is the Security
(G) Record. After the single-line <a href="#link_A">A record</a> is the multi-line Header (H) Record, followed by the I and J
Records that list extension data which applies to later Record types in the file. These are followed by other
Record types indicating that certain data is recorded in the file, including the task/declaration (C) Record,
and the initial Satellite Constellation (F). Time-specific Records follow, placed in the file in time order
using either GNSS fix-time (if the GNSS is locked on) or the FR Real Time Clock (RTC); these are B (fix),
E (event), F (constellation change) & K (extension data). The logbook/comments (L) Record data may be
placed anywhere after the H, I and <a href="#link_J">J records</a> and can have several lines throughout the file depending on
the nature of the comments included.</p>
The following sequence of Record types is typical, although in a real flight data file there will be many
more fix <a href="#link_B">B record</a> lines than shown here:
<pre>
IGC DATA FILE FORMAT - ORDER OF RECORD TYPES IN AN IGC FILE
A - FR manufacturer and identification (always first)
H - File header
I - Fix extension list, of data added at end of each B
record
J - Extension list of data in each K record line
C - Task/declaration (if used)
L - Logbook/comments (if used)
D - Differential GPS (if used)
F - Initial Satellite Constellation
B - Fix plus any extension data listed in <a href="#link_I">I Record</a>
B - Fix plus any extension data listed in <a href="#link_I">I Record</a>
E - Pilot Event (PEV)
B - Fix plus any extension data listed in <a href="#link_I">I Record</a>

L - Logbook/comments (if used)
G - Security record (always last)
</pre>

<p><b><a name="link_2.4"></a>2.4 UNITS.</b>
<p>Data in the IGC file shall use the following unit system:</p>
Time - UTC, obtained from the same GNSS data package from which the recorded lat/long and GPS altitude are
also obtained, or, if GPS is not locked on, from the Real-Time Clock in the recorder. Note that UTC is not the
same as GPS internal system time that is different by 14 seconds in 2006 due to the addition of 'leap seconds'
since the GPS system first became operational in January 1980. The correction to UTC available within the GPS
system must be applied to time recorded in IGC files.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al9.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL9</small></a>)</p>
<pre>
Distance - Kilometres and decimal kilometres. For FAI/IGC conversions from feet and miles, see para 2.6.8
(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)
Speed - Kilometres per hour. For FAI/IGC conversions from nautical miles per hour (knots) and statute miles
per hour (mph), see para <a href="#link_2.6.8">2.6.8</a>(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)
Date (of the first line in the <a href="#link_B">B record</a>) - UTC DDMMYY (day, month, year). See para <a href="#link_2.5.4">2.5.4</a>(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)
Direction - degrees True, clockwise from 000 (North)
Latitude and Longitude - Degrees, minutes and decimal minutes with N,S,E,W designators
Altitude - Metres, separate records for GNSS and pressure altitudes.
Pressure - Hectopascals (the same as millibars) to two decimal places, for instance altimeter subscale setting, but
see * below under PPPPpp
</pre>

The above items shall be recorded in the flight log as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Time - HHMMSSsss (UTC)</b><br/>
HH- Hours fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
MM - Minutes fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
SS - Seconds fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 whre necessary<br/>
sss - number of decimal seconds are those available in the Record concerned, less fields already used for
HHMMSS.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al8.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL8</small></a>)
</li>
<li>
<b>Distance - DDDDddd</b>, kilometres up to 9999 with leading zeros as required and then three decimal places (that
is, the last figure is metres)
</li>
<li><b>Speed - SSSsss.</b><br/>
 SSS - fixed to 3 digits with leading 0<br/>
sss - number of speed decimals (the number of fields recorded are those available for speed in the Record
concerned, less fields already used for SSS)
</li>
<li><b>Date - DDMMYY</b><br/>
DD- number of the day in the month, fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
MM - number of the month in year, fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
YY- number of the year modulo 100, fixed to 2 digits with leading 0 where necessary
</li>
<li><b>Direction DDDddd.</b><br/>
 DDD - fixed to 3 digits with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
ddd - number of direction decimals (the number of fields recorded are those available for direction in the Record
concerned, less fields already used for DDD)
</li><b>Lat/Long - D D M Mm m m N D D D M M m m m E</b><br/>
DD- Latitude degrees with leading 0 where necessary<br/>
DDD - Longitude degrees with leading 0 or 00 where necessary<br/>
MMmmmNSEW - Lat/Long minutes with leading 0 where necessary, 3 decimal places of minutes (mandatory,
not optional), followed by North, South, East or West letter as appropriate<br/>
</li>
<li><b>Altitude - AAAAAaaa</b><br/>
AAAAA - fixed to 5 digits with leading 0<br/>
aaa - number of altitude decimals (the number of fields recorded are those available for altitude in the Record
concerned, less fields already used for AAAAA)
</li>
<li><b>PPPPpp - Pressure in hPa (mb)</b> with two decimal places, PPPPpp fixed to 6 digits with leading zero for settings
in the 900 range). For altimeter subscale settings, 1013.25 mb (ISA Sea Level) has an PPPPpp code of 101325,
and 980 mb has a code of 098000.<br/>
* An altimeter setting (and any change to it) may be recorded, for instance where the FR feeds a cockpit display
(three-letter code ATS, see <a href="#link_7">para 7</a>). However, it must not be used to change the pressure altitude recorded with
each fix in the IGC file, which must remain with respect to the ISA sea level datum (1013.25 mb) at all times.
</li>
<li><b>GNSS Altitude.</b> Where GNSS altitude is not available from GNSS position-lines such as in the case of a 2D fix
(altitude drop-out), it shall be recorded in the IGC format file as zero so that the lack of valid GNSS altitude can
be clearly seen during post-flight analysis.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al3.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL3</small></a>)

<p><a name="link_2.5.2"></a><b>2.5.2</b> Long file name style. This uses a full set of characters in each field, a hyphen separating each field,
the field order being the same as in the short file name. For instance, if the short name for a file from
manufacturer X is 36HXABC2.IGC, the equivalent long file name is 2003-06-17-XXX-ABC-02.IGC.
Long file names may be generated by software that is compatible with long file names, although the DOS
versions of the DATA, CONV and VALI programs must continue to generate and use short file names.
(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al3.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL3</small></a>)
<p><a name="link_2.5.3"></a><b>2.5.3</b> FR Serial Number (S/N). The three-character FR S/N must be used in the <a href="#link_A">A record</a> and be imprinted
on the case of the recorder unless there is an easily-accessible electronic display which includes the S/N.
<p><a name="link_2.5.3.1"></a>2.5.3.1 Existing FRs using serial numbers with coded systems where the XXX translates to a different
five-number numerical code which is used in the <a href="#link_A">A record</a>, have "Grandfather Rights" and do not need
to be changed. New FRs must use the three-alphanumeric system described above.
<p>2.5.4. Date of flight - the date used in the file name and in the <a href="#link_H">H record</a> (DTE code) is the UTC date of the
first valid fix in the flight log transferred after flight. That is, the date applicable to the time in the first line
in the B (fix) record, not the date at the time of switching on, or of take-off. This is particularly important
for recorders operated in time zones where they are switched on close to midnight UTC.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)
<p>2.5.5. Security of file name. The file name is not protected by the electronic security system, which only
applies to data within the file itself (see chapter 2, para 2.8). File names may be changed for specific
purposes such as competitions, where it may be found more convenient to change from the IGC name
system in which the file is originally transferred from the FR (para 2.5), to a system using glider
competition number or pilot name. No loss of data or security occurs, since all of the data in the IGC file
name is repeated in the file itself in the A and <a href="#link_H">H records</a>. (AL2) Example:
16AFXYZ2.IGC = 10 June 2001, Filser FR number XYZ, Flight 2 of the day.
<p><a name="link_2.5.6"></a><b>2.5.6</b> Manufacturer codes. Single- and three-character codes are tabulated below. Manufacturers applying
and paying the fee for IGC-approval who are not listed should apply to the Chairman of GFAC for
allocation of codes. Manufacturers using the IGC file format but not applying for IGC-approval should use
the X and XXX codes, see note 2 at the end.
<p><a name="link_2.5.6.1"></a>2.5.6.1 Name of Intermediate Format file. If a manufacturer chooses a system where data is
download from the recorder in an intermediate format such as binary, the file name for the
intermediate format shall be as for the IGC file but with the Manufacturer's three letter code used
instead of the "IGC" after the dot. It shall then be possible to convert the intermediate format to the
IGC ASCII format through the Conversion utility that is part of the manufacturer's IGC-XXX.DLL
file or, for earlier systems, through the CONV-XXX.EXE program.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al8.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL8</small></a>)

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where possible, the initial letter of a manufacturer's name will be allocated for the single-character code.
Where this letter is already allocated, generally, the next letter in the manufacturer's name will be used, etc.
</li>
<li>X and XXX are general designations for IGC format files from manufacturers who do not produce an
IGC-approved recorder. Such recorders will not have been tested and evaluated by GFAC and may not fulfil
certain aspects of the IGC Specification such as security protections, recording of pressure altitude, ENL or
other variables. There is no guarantee that the file will conform exactly to the IGC format, although specimen
files will be checked for compliance with the IGC format if emailed to the GFAC chairman for evaluation.
Even after this procedure, no compliance guarantee can be made because the type of recorder will not have
completed a full GFAC evaluation. It should be noted that although the file name will not contain the
information, the details of the manufacturer and the recorder model concerned will be identifiable (if the file
conforms to the IGC standard) because they will be included in the H (Header) record, see below under H
Record in the line: HFFTYFRTYPE:MANUFACTURERSNAME,FRMODELNUMBER CRLF

<p><b><a name="link_3.3"></a><a name="link_H"></a>3.3 H RECORD - FILEHEADER</b></p>
<p>The H-Record is used to store data such as the date on which fixes are first
recorded in the B-Record of the IGC file (that is, the day of a flight unless made in a time zone many hours from
UTC), the name of the pilot, glider, the type of FR used, the type of GNSS receiver and pressure altitude
sensor, amongst other things. There are several different subtypes of the H-Record which are recorded on
separate lines prefixed H. All Three Letter Codes (CCC) that bear the H flag in section 7 are possible subtypes
of the H-Record.</p>
<p>The line entries in the H-record may be created by the FR (source code F), or, for items such as pilot and glider
names, by the Pilot or OO (P and O source records) after flight (see the line "Data Source" in the table below).
Only H-Record data with source code F is covered by the security code and VALI check system.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al10.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL10</small></a>)</p>

<p>Appendix 1, Para 3.3, second paragraph. The words at the end to read
The general format of the H-Record is: record identifier, source of information (S), record subtype identifer
(CCC), long name of the record subtype, colon, actual information (TEXTSTRING). The long name is intended
as an aid for people reading the file. For official purposes only the source of information, the record subtype
(CCC) and the actual information are definitive.</p>

<p>GNSS Geodetic Datum. The long name, a colon and the name of the Geodetic Datum set (WGS84 = IGC
number 100, see para 8) come after the IGC-assigned number for the GPS-Datum, which is located directly

<p><b><a name="link_3.4"></a><a name="link_I"></a>3.4 I RECORD - EXTENSIONS TO THE FIX <a href="#link_B">B record</a>.</b> The I record defines any extensions to the fix
<a href="#link_B">B record</a> in the form of a list of the appropriate Three-Letter Codes (CCC), data for which will appear at the
end of subsequent B Records. Only one I-Record line is included in each file, located after the <a href="#link_H">H record</a> and
before the first B Record. The Fix Accuracy (<a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a>) must be included, in the form of the Estimated Position
Error figure (see Glossary under EPE). This shall be followed by SIU, ENL and RPM, if these are recorded in
the FR concerned. Note that although the SIU number is optional in the B record, the F Record (satellite
constellation used) is mandatory, see para <a href="#link_4.3">4.3</a>.

The format of the I Record is as follows:(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al11.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL11</small></a>)</p>

<p> The first byte of the extension data always begins at
    byte position 36, because that's where the basic lat/long/alt stuff of the B record ends.
</p>

<p>The byte count starts from the beginning of the B Record, taking the first B in the line as byte one. Example:</p>
<pre>
I 01 36 40 FXA CR LF
</pre>
<p>This shows that Fix Accuracy (<a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a>) is recorded between&nbsp;bytes 36 and 40 on each B-record line. And, for a
device that also records Satellites In Use (SIU) and Engine Noise Level (ENL):</p>
<pre>
I 04 3638 FXA 3940 SIU 4143 ENL 4446 RPM CR LF
</pre>
<p>This shows that on each B-record line, Fix Accuracy (<a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a>) is recorded between&nbsp;bytes 36 and 38, Satellites In
Use (SIU) between&nbsp;bytes 39 and 40, Engine Noise Level (ENL) between&nbsp;bytes 41 and 43 and RPM between
bytes 44 and 46. To aid clarity, some spaces have been inserted in the example line above, these should not be

updated as a flight progresses but is not required as often as fix <a href="#link_B">B records</a>. The J record is a single line that
defines what data will be in subsequent K-record lines. It fulfils the same function for the K Record as the I
Record (3.4 above) does for the fix <a href="#link_B">B record</a>, and operates in the same way. It is placed in the file
immediately after the I record line, before the first B Record. The format of the J Record is as follows:</p>

<p><b><a name="link_3.6"></a><a name="link_C"></a>3.6 C RECORD - TASK.</b> (Pre-flight Declaration) </p>
<p>The C Record is used to specify tasks and to make preflight
declarations. It is placed in the IGC file before the first fix <a href="#link_B">B record</a> and after the H, I and J records.</p>

<p><a name="link_3.6.1"></a><b>3.6.1</b> Lines in the C Record. The first line contains the UTC-date and UTC-time of the declaration, the
local date of the intended day of flight, the task ID, the number of turn points of the task and a textstring
which can be used to describe the task (500k triangle, etc). Optionally, the recorder may be configured so
that a pilot can enter the intended flight date in local time, not the UTC date which will be different in
countries with large time offsets from UTC (The Three-Letter Code for Time Zone Offset is TZN, see the
list in <a href="#link_7">para 7</a>). The other lines contain the WGS84 lat/long coordinates and a textstring for the place or
point concerned. These include the take-off airfield, start point, turn points, finish point and landing
airfield. After the first line, the other lines contain the WGS84 lat/long co-ordinates of the point followed
by a text string for the place or point concerned. The text describing the type of point (see example below)
is mandatory so that the nature of the points can be clearly seen by viewing the IGC file.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>) & 11)

<p><a name="link_3.6.2"></a><b>3.6.2</b> IGC terminology. "Waypoint or way point " refers to a either a start-, turn- or finish-point. The
term "Turn Point" refers to a point in a measured course between the start and finish point. The points that
must be specified exactly in an official IGC flight declaration are the intended start-, turn- and finish-points
(Sporting Code Section 3, para 4.2). The number of turn points will be nil for a straight goal flight, one for
an out-and-return, two for a triangle, three for 3-TP distance, more for some competition tasks.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)

<p><a name="link_3.6.3"></a><b>3.6.3</b> Takeoff and Landing. The two lines in the C-record format for takeoff airfield and landing airfield
(or out-landing location if this applies), are for general information rather than being part of the official
IGC Flight Declaration. They can be entered approximately or, if the co-ordinates are difficult to obtain or
are not entered, the recorder shall default to 00000000N000000000E for these two lines.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)

<p><a name="link_3.6.4"></a><b>3.6.4</b> Number of Turn points and C-Record lines. From the above it can be seen that the number of turn
points will be four less than the number of lines after line 1 (that is, those lines that contain lat/long data).
These four non-turn point data lines are for takeoff airfield, exact start, exact finish, and landing
airfield/location. The number of turn points is included as a sub-field in line 1 of the C-record and is
placed immediately before the optional text string at the end of the line (in the form TT in the illustration
below).(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)

<p><a name="link_3.6.5"></a><b>3.6.5</b> Area Tasks. The incorporation of this facility in a Flight Recorder is optional. In some
competitions, an area to be reached is specified with respect to a Waypoint in terms of distances and true
bearings (radials) from the point. If a recorder has a facility to enter this in the C record, the following
system shall be followed in the IGC file: At the end of the relevant Waypoint line in the C record,
minimum and maximum distances follow in kilometers from the WP, followed by bearing 1 and bearing 2
in degrees true from the WP and then the word AREA after the type of point. In the case of competitions
using units other than kilometres (such as statute or international nautical miles), a conversion must be
made so that the IGC file continues to be in kilometres (and decimal kilometres as necessary). The area is
clockwise from bearing 1 to 2. In the case of circular areas round a point the two bearings used shall be
000 to 360 and the minimum distance will be zero. Where an area referenced to a Waypoint is to be
specified, after the C record line that defines the Waypoint but before CRLF at the end of the line, add:</p>
<pre>
"DDDDdddDDDDdddBBBbbbBBBbbbAREA"
</pre>

<p>The two distances Dd are first minimum distance from the WP in km and decimal kilometres, then
maximum distance. The two bearings Bb are in degrees and decimal degrees true from the WP, the task
area extending clockwise from bearing 1 to 2.</p>

<p>For instance: "C....0012000 0032000 122000 182000TURN AREA" would be an area from 12 to 32 km
from the WP between the bearings 122 and 182 from the Point.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al6.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL6</small></a>)</p>

<p>The format of C Record is as follows, using N latitude and E longitude for the example:</p>
<pre>
C DD MM YY HH MM SS F D F M F Y IIII TT TEXT STRING CR LF
C DD MM MMM N DDD MMMMM E TAKEOFF TEXT STRING CR LF

<h2><a name="link_4"></a>4.MULTIPLE INSTANCE DATA RECORDS</h2>

<p>These are record types that can re-occur at different times in
the course of the IGC file, unlike single instance records that occur in each file only in one place.</p>

<p><b><a name="link_4.1"></a><a name="link_B"></a>4.1 B RECORD - FIX.</b> Not counting the last CRLF, this includes 35&nbsp;bytes for its basic data plus those for
characters that are defined in the <a href="#link_I">I Record</a>. Such as Fix Accuracy (<a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a>, in the form of the Estimated
Position Error figure, see Glossary under EPE), Satellites In Use (SIU), Engine Noise Level (ENL for all
motor gliders), RPM (additional for motor gliders with quiet engines). The required basic data is: UTC,
WGS84latitude,WGS84 longitude, fix validity, Fix Accuracy, pressure altitude and GNSS-altitude. All of
the information within each B-record must have a data issue time within 0.1 seconds of the time given in the
B-record. Where NMEA data is used within the FR, fix data should be taken either from the GGA or GNS
sentences. GGA is specific to the US GPS system. GNS is intended for all GNSS systems (GPS,
GLONASS, Galileo and future systems), and should be used if it is available from the GNSS board installed.
In the B Record <a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a> should be recorded as a three-figure group in metres and SIU as a two group number.
SIU is an optional record and may be used to back up the more detailed satellite data in the mandatory
<a href="#link_F">F record</a>. Leading zeros should be included as necessary. Because earlier IGC-approved GNSS FRs may
not have <a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a> and SIU in their B-records, the position of this data in each B record line must be indicated
(for instance to analysis programs) by including them in the <a href="#link_I">I record</a> which designates the positions of
additional fields in the B record. <a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a> should be placed after the two groups for altitude, followed by
optional fields such as SIU and then ENL for Motor Gliders. In each B-record line, <a href="#link_FXA">FXA</a> would therefore

<p><b><a name="link_4.2"></a><a name="link_E"></a>4.2 E RECORD - EVENTS.</b></p>
<p>The E-record is used to record specific events on the IGC file that occur at
irregular intervals. Such events include a pilot-initiated event (PEV code) or, for recorders fitted with proximity
sensing devices, a proximity event using one of the appropriate Three-Letter Codes followed by the appropriate
data as defined under the appropriate TLC in <a href="#link_7">section 7</a>. The E Record is placed before the individual fix
<a href="#link_B">B&nbsp;record</a> for the same time that shows where and when the event occurred. Events must have a Three Letter Code
(TLC) from <a href="#link_7">section 7</a>. More than one event record may be used at the same time, but Events initiated within the
FR (as opposed to by the pilot) are only expected to be occasional in the time-history of the flight file and
should not be used for making additional records with every fix. This may confuse the analysis programs
designed for use with this file format, which often search for and highlight event records. If a FR manufacturer
wishes to insert additional information with each fix, this should be through an extension to the <a href="#link_B">B record</a>, first
listing the information Code (CCC) in the <a href="#link_I">I record</a>. (amended (<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al9.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL9</small></a>)</p>

<p>If a manufacturer wants to add a new type of event, a new Three Letter Code (<a href="#link_7">para 7</a>) should be requested from
GFAC. The manufacturer must provide an exact definition of the event and a proposed coding. GFAC may
decide that the proposal should not be treated as an event but that the information should be incorporated into
the B- or <a href="#link_K">K record</a> in the normal way for these records by listing in the I and <a href="#link_J">J records</a>.</p>

<p>The form of the E-Record is record identifer, time, TLC, textstring. Some examples follow:</p>
<pre>
E 1 0 4 5 3 3 P E V CR LF
B 1 0 4 5 3 3 4 9 4 5 3 3 3 N 0 1 1 3 2 4 4 4 E A 0 1 3 5 7 0 1 5 0 1 CR LF
</pre>

<p>This indicates a pilot initiated event (PEV) at 10:45:33 UTC, and the associated <a href="#link_B">B record</a> shows the location
49:45.333 N 11:32.444 E, at the pressure altitude 1357 metres and GNSS altitude 1501 metres.</p>

<p>Some events require more than just the TLC for interpretation:</p>
<pre>
E 1 0 4 5 4 4 A T S 1 0 2 3 1 2 CR LF
</pre>

<p>The altimeter setting in a display device connected to the FR was changed to 1023.12 hPa at the time 10:45:44</p>

</pre>
<p>The engine was turned on (EON) at 10:45:55 UTC, and the <a href="#link_B">B record</a> shows the location 49:45.333 N 11:32.444
E, at the pressure altitude 1337 metres and GNSS altitude 1567 metres.</p>
<pre>
E 1 0 4 7 3 3 C G D 1 0 3 CR LF
</pre>
<p>The geodetic datum was changed to Bessel (IGC number 103, see para 8) at 10:47:33 UTC.
This would invalidate the recording for IGC purposes, for which WGS84 must be used.</p>

<p><b><a name="link_4.3"></a><a name="link_F"></a>4.3 F RECORD - SATELLITE CONSTELLATION.</b></p>

<p>This is a <b>mandatory record</b>. However, there is no requirement to update the F-record at intervals of less than 5
minutes, so that transient changes of satellites received due to changing angles of bank, flying in valleys, etc do
not lead to frequent F-record lines. For the US GPS system, the satellite ID for each satellite is the PRN of the
satellite in question, for other satellite systems the ID will be assigned by GFAC as the need arises. Where
NMEA data is used within the FR, the ID should be taken from the GSA sentence that lists the IDs of those
satellites used in the fixes which are recorded in the <a href="#link_B">B record</a>. The F Record is not recorded continuously but at
the start of fixing and then only when a change in satellites used is detected.(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al4.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL4</small></a>)</p>

<p><b><a name="link_4.4"></a><a name="link_K"></a>4.4 K RECORD - DATA NEEDED LESS FREQUENTLY THAN FIXES.</b></p>
<p>The K record is for data that
may be needed less frequently than fix <a href="#link_B">B records</a>. The K record should have a default interval of 20 seconds.
As an example, if the <a href="#link_B">B record</a> records every 5 seconds, the K-record could be set to record every 20 seconds,
for instance containing true heading (HDT). The contents of the K record are listed in the <a href="#link_J">J record</a>. The
following <a href="#link_J">J Record</a> specifies the information in the K Record in the next line:</p>
<pre>
J 0 8 1 2 H D T CR LF

</pre>
<p>This K Record states that the true heading (TLC = HDT) is 090 (East).</p>

<p><b><a name="link_4.5"></a><a name="link_L"></a>4.5 L RECORD - LOG BOOK/COMMENTS.</b> L-Records can be placed anywhere in the file after H, I and J
records but before the <a href="#link_G">G record</a>. The L-Record allows multiple free format text lines to be added to the flight
data records at any time in the time-sequence, although this record is not itself time-stamped. It can be initiated
by a program in the FR, by pilots or official observers, and the term "comment record" may be more descriptive
rather than "logbook". The FR Manufacturer three-letter ID (para 2.5) should be used in the case of data
initiated by the FR, and in this case the manufacturer should state how to interpret this type of L-Record for the
benefit of writers of software for the IGC format. In other cases this field (MMM below) will also be three
spaces, initiated by the pilot (code PLT) or OO (OOI) as required. In the case of Free Flights where waypoints
are claimed post-flight by the pilot, the PFC (Post-Flight Claim) code shall be used followed by the Waypoints
in the same format as the <a href="#link_C">C Record</a> (Pre-flight declaration). It is expected that this data will be inserted by a
software program (for instance, after transfer of the flight data to a PC immediately after flight, by a program
outside the FR) rather than added manually, so that it is in the correct format and can be recognised by analysis
programs that are designed to read Post-Flight Claim data and present the flight on screen together with the PFC
waypoints. Note that L records when originated by a pilot or OO must not affect the VALI check for the rest of
the file data. The format of the L Record is as follows:(<a href="http://www.fai.org/gliding/system/files/tech_spec_gnss_al5.pdf" target=_blank><small>AL5</small></a>)</p>

<h2><a name="link_8"></a>8. GNSS GEODETIC DATUMS</h2>
<p>The Sporting Code for gliding states that the WGS 84 Geodetic Datum
(serial 100 below) shall be used for all lat/long co-ordinates that are recorded and transferred from the FR after
flight. Other Geodetic Datums have been numbered by IGC as follows.</p>

<p><i>Note from Ian Forster-Lewis: I skipped this section - just use WGS84 IGC code </i><b>100.</b></p>

<h2><a name="link_9"></a>9. EXAMPLE IGC-FORMAT FILE</h2>

<a href="complex_example_lxn.igc">this LXN-produced IGC file from a real flight in 2022</a>
</p>
<p><b><a name="link_9.1"></a>9.1</b>
The IGC file format starts with the <a href="#link_A">A Record</a> and is followed by the H (header) and other records. The
record letter is always at the start of the appropriate line in the file when it is viewed in text format. For
more details of formats for individual records, see the relevant paragraphs earlier in this Appendix.</p>
<p><b><a name="link_9.2"></a>9.2</b> In this example, spaces have been used between subject fields to make the layout and sequence clearer
to a reader. In a real IGC-format file there should be no spaces in any record except within a text string as
a word separator.</p>
<p><b><a name="link_9.3"></a>9.3</b> CRLF&nbsp;=&nbsp;line terminator, not flight data.</p>
