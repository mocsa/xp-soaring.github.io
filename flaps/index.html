<h1>Flaps</h1>

<h2>'how':</h2>

Most importantly, understand that glider wings and glider flaps operate a bit differently than powered aircraft.
Where everyone will agree the aerofoil profile is important to all kinds of planes, that does not emphasise enough
that gliding is ALL about the aerofoil profile while the thrust of most powered planes is so dominant that the
thrust setting and angle of attack is a good enough first approximation to work out whether the plane will be
climbing/sinking etc. At the same time glider aerofoils are genuinely "laminar flow" which provides a lift/drag
performance in a different category than virtually all powered planes. Powered pilots may refer to planes such as
the P-51 Mustang from the 1940's as if those wings (which at the time were describes as laminar) are somehow
comparable but even then there is little real comparison with gliders are it was not until the era of glass-reinforced
plastics that true laminar-flow aerofoils were possible. On a power plane, as a first approximation, the flaps might
as well be solid straight boards that can be angled into the airstream, and indeed this is how they are modelled
in MSFS. The angled boards will generate a downwards force (lift) and a considerable amount of extra drag. Power
planes (Cessna to 747) will either use their powerful engines to overcome this drag, or will take advantage of
the additional drag to slow down or descend. Power plane flaps are LARGE, and stuck out a long way into the
airstream to get the max effect. In the main, power planes only need flaps as they come into land so the assumption
is flaps are necessarily high lift / high drag control surfaces.

Gliders, on the other hand, use flaps to modify the wing profile. Glider flaps are small and very high aspect ratio,
typically running along the entire trailing edge of the wing (i.e. combined with ailerons to form 'flaperons').
Gliders are all about MAXIMISING the GLIDE RATIO (which is equal to the LIFT/DRAG RATIO). For example the AS33 has
a best glide ratio of about 56:1. For comparison a power plane considered to be exceptionally efficient will have
a glide ratio in the mid-teens. Even with a wingspan approaching that of a 737, a glider's flaps might be only 8cm
wide. The 56:1 glide ratio for the AS33 in zero flap occurs at a particular SPEED around 60 knots, and if the glider
didn't have flaps that would be all you have to work with and cross-country flying speeds would be calculated using
that base. What the flaps do (in adjusting the wing profile) is move that 'best glide' performance up and down the
speed range.
