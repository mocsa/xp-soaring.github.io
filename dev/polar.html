        <p>Simply put, the <i>polar curve</i> for an aircraft shows you how fast the aircraft
            will <i>sink</i> in the air for each <i>forward speed</i>, e.g. as for the Schleicher
            ASH 25 below:
        <p>

        <p>This curve will be different for each model of aircraft, with a high-efficiency aircraft
            sinking <i>less</i> than a typical aircraft at the same forward speed. By this measure sailplanes
            are much more efficient than powered aircraft.  For example, a modern glider of
            18m span flying at 50 knots in still air will be sinking at about 1 knot and will be said
            to have a <i>glide ratio</i> of 50:1.
        </p>

        <p>The glide performance of a given sailplane will alter according to its all-up <i>weight</i> and
        also its <i>flap setting</i>. Greater weight and/or a negative flap setting pushes the entire curve
        down and to the right, i.e. the glider can fly faster for a given amount of sink. This advantage in
        high-speed flight is complimented with a significant disadvantage when flying slowly. Many gliders
        carry water ballast, e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASW_28">ASW28</a> can
        carry 200Kg of water even though the aircraft has an empty weight of only 240Kg. This ballast
        provides exceptional high-speed performance but can be dumped in weak conditions. A pilot flying a
        sailplane with flaps will routinely be pushing the aircraft into negative flap when flying fast
        between thermals, and will pull the flaps back into a high positive setting when circling in a
        thermal. Flap settings may be referred to as (in order) Landing, Thermalling, Zero, Negative One,
        Negative Two. For any given speed there is an optimal choice for flap setting.
        </p>

            The polar curve at the top of this page is for the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASH_25">Schleicher ASH 25</a> 25-meter 
            high-performance sailplane which has flaps and carries water ballast:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Flaps</i>: the polar curve as drawn assumes the pilot is accurately selecting
                the appropriate flap setting for each speed, e.g. at 100knots the pilot will definitely
                be in Negative Two.  So the polar curve is actually the composite of segments for each
                flap setting
                </li>
                <li><i>Ballast</i>: the <i>two</i> curves on the chart are for empty ballast (solid line)
                    and maximum all-up-weight (dashed line) respectively - if you're light enough this will
                    be with max ballast). You're expected to interpolate between the curves for ballast 
                    weights in between. Note that rather than refer to ballast quantities, the norm is
                    for the polar refer to <i>wing loading</i> i.e. the total weight divided by the wing
                    area (hence units of kg per square meter).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>The polar curve for the 25-meter ASH-25 shows a sink rate of 2m/s at a flying speed of 200km/h
            (In imperial measures that's 3.9knots sink at 108knots) for a glide ratio of about 28:1.
        </p>
        <p>For comparison the polar curve below for the 18-meter ASW-29 shows it sinking at 1.75m/s at the
            same 200km/h flying speed, for a glide ratio of about 32:1. Counter-intuitively the cheaper
            smaller 18m sailplane is better at 200km/h than the ASH-25 25m sailplane. However, if 
            conditions turn weak then the ASH-25 will win.
