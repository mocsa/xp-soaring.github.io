            Glider Variometers</h1>

        <p>Glider varios are all derivatives (pun intended) of the original
            aviation <b>vertical speed indicator</b>, also known as the "rate
            of climb" instrument. The basic VSI is a simple instrument, connected
            <i>only</i> to the aircraft external static pressure source which
            provides a reading proportional to altitude above sea level, and 
            give the reading you'd expect, i.e. how fast you are climbing or
            descending.
        </p>
        <p>The basic vertical speed indicator is pretty much useless for soaring as
            the absolute up and down movements of the plane are dominated by your
            movement of the joystick so effectively you're watching a gauge that
            tells you how far forwards or back you've pulled the stick. For thermal
            air movement you want to somehow <i>subtract</i> your short-term movement
            of the controls, and that is what the <i>compensation</i> in glider varios
            is designed to do. Nevertheless, the default 'vario' in aviation simulators
            has a long history of having zero or broken compensation.

        <p>A comment on <i>units</i>: Aircraft speed display is usually <i>knots</i>
            (i.e. nautical miles per hour) or <i>kilometers per hour</i>. For
            vertical speed the instrument may use <i>knots</i>, <i>100's of feet
            per minute</i>, or <i>meters per second</i>. I.e. the subtlety here is
            that <i>different</i> units may be used for speeds in different directions,
            although conveniently 100 feet per minute is ~1 knot or ~.5 meter/second.
            </p>
            <p>
            IMHO, if you <i>program</i> instrument software, the <i>only</i> sensible
            approach is <b>use SI units thoughout</b>, i.e. <i>meters per second</i> for
            speed, <i>meters</i> for distances including height, and <i>seconds</i> for 
            time.

<h2 id="te">Total Energy vario</h2>
    <p>This section is the key concept of glider variometers - the extensions below for
        'netto' and 'speed-to-fly' are relatively simple if you understand total energy.
    </p>
    <div class="center"><img src="../images/winter_vario.png"/></div>
    <p>For a glider in still air flying at a steady speed a basic VSI will show some descent
        rate, e.g. at 50 knots the VSI might show a sink rate of 1 knot. For a glider pilot
        that steady sink rate is a crucial indication of <i>energy loss</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>Note that a glider contains <i>two</i> forms of energy:
        <ol>
            <li><i>Potential Energy</i> based on how high it is above the ground.
            </li>
            <li><i>Kinetic Energy</i> based on how fast it is moving.
            </li>
        </ol>
        These forms of energy are partially interchangeable in that if you dive you are
        converting potential energy into kinetic energy, and if you pull up then the
        reverse.
    </p>
    <p>For a soaring pilot that <i>exchange of energy</i> is <b>totally irrelevant</b>. It is
        only the actual energy <b>losses</b> that the pilot cares about. In the absence of drag
        a pilot could dive from 2000 feet to 1000 feet, then back up to 2000 feet and be back
        at the same speed and height they were before.
    </p>
    <p>A pilot is familiar with interpreting the steady-state sink rate as an indication of
        energy loss (to the extent they don't even think about it). So here is the key concept:
    </p>
    <p><b>Can the VSI be designed in a way such that <i>total energy losses</i> during diving 
        or climbing can be represented on the needle in an exactly proportional way to the
        energy losses being shown as sink rate during steady flight?
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>The answer is of course "yes" and the method is to add an adjustment (or <i>compensation</i>)
        to the rate-of-climb needle if the glider's speed is changing. I.e. if the glider is
        accelerating that represents an increase in energy which can be <i>added</i> to the needle,
        and vice-versa if it's decelerating.
    </p>
    <p>A glider in still air will <i>only</i> accelerate when it's descending (and vice-versa) so
    this positive acceleration compensation will act to move the sinking needle back towards zero.
    A TE indication in still air should <i>always</i> be negative (think about it). The most 
    dramatic effect of the compensation is the needle no longer swings up and down wildly as you
    push-pull the stick, as mostly the short-term height losses will be compensated for by an
    increase in the speed of the glider, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <h3>Total Energy math</h3>

    <p>Potential energy due to height of glider = m * g * h</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where m = mass of glider (kg), g = gravitational constant (9.81), h = height (meters)</p>
    <p>Kinetic energy = m * v<sup>2</sup>/2</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where v = speed of glider (m/s)</p>
    <p>Rate of potential energy change during ascent/descent = m * g * (h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) / t</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where h<sub>1</sub> = start height (m), h<sub>2</sub> = end height (m), 
        t = time (seconds beween glider at h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub>)
    </p>
    <p>Similarly rate of energy change during acceleration/deceleration = 
        m * (v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(2 * t)
    </p>
    <p>So total energy change is m * g * (h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) / t +
        m * (v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(2 * t)
    </p>
    <p>Now assume steady flying in still air (i.e. no change of speed) then the second term
        will be zero and the energy loss is resulting from the height change only i.e. 
        m * g * (h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) / t. Note that is m * g * (basic climb rate).
    </p>
    <p>This tells you that the VSI needle showing "basic climb rate" can also be interpreted as
        showing "(rate of potential energy change) / (m * g)".  If we divide "rate of kinetic 
        energy change"
        by the same amount, then this energy change can be represented on the needle in the same
        proportion as the potential energy change such that the needle now displays <i>both</i>
        energy changes represented as an <i>equivalent</i> sink rate.
    </p>
    <p>Hence the "total energy" sink rate to display on the instrument is (basic sink rate) +
        (rate of kinetic energy change divided by (m * g)). I.e.
    </p>
    <p>TE vario reading = (h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) / t + 
        m * (v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(2 * t * m * g), simplified to
    </p>
    <p><b>TE reading = ((h<sub>1</sub> - h<sub>2</sub>) + (v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)/(2 * g)) / t</b>,
     where g = 9.81, h in meters, v in m/s, TE reading in m/s.
