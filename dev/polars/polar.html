        <p>Simply put, the <i>polar curve</i> for an aircraft shows you how fast the aircraft
            will <i>sink</i> in the air for each <i>forward speed</i>. This performance curve
            needs to be modelled accurately in simulated sailplanes.
        </p>

        <p> E.g. for the ASH25 Open Class sailplane:
        </p>

        <img src="images/polar.png"/>

        <p>This curve will be different for each model of aircraft, with a high-efficiency aircraft
            sinking <i>less</i> than a typical aircraft at the same forward speed. By this measure sailplanes
            are much more efficient than powered aircraft.  For example, a modern glider of
            18m span flying at 50 knots in still air will be sinking at about 1 knot and will be said
            to have a <i>glide ratio</i> of 50:1.
        </p>

        <p>The glide performance of a given sailplane will alter according to its all-up <i>weight</i> and
        also its <i>flap setting</i>. Greater weight and/or a negative flap setting pushes the entire curve
        down and to the right, i.e. the glider can fly faster for a given amount of sink. This advantage in
        high-speed flight is complimented with a significant disadvantage when flying slowly. Many gliders
        carry water ballast, e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASW_28">ASW28</a> can
        carry 200Kg of water even though the aircraft has an empty weight of only 240Kg. This ballast
        provides exceptional high-speed performance but can be dumped in weak conditions. A pilot flying a
        sailplane with flaps will routinely be pushing the aircraft into negative flap when flying fast
        between thermals, and will pull the flaps back into a high positive setting when circling in a
        thermal. Flap settings may be referred to as (in order) Landing, Thermalling, Zero, Negative One,
        Negative Two. For any given speed there is an optimal choice for flap setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            The polar curve at the top of this page is for the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleicher_ASH_25">Schleicher ASH 25</a> 25-meter
            high-performance sailplane which has flaps and carries water ballast:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Flaps</i>: the polar curve as drawn assumes the pilot is accurately selecting
                the appropriate flap setting for each speed, e.g. at 100knots the pilot will definitely
                be in Negative Two.  So the polar curve is actually the composite of segments for each
                flap setting
                </li>
                <li><i>Ballast</i>: the <i>two</i> curves on the chart are for empty ballast (solid line)
                    and maximum all-up-weight (dashed line) respectively - if you're light enough this will
                    be with max ballast). You're expected to interpolate between the curves for ballast
                    weights in between. Note that rather than refer to ballast quantities, the norm is
                    for the polar refer to <i>wing loading</i> i.e. the total weight divided by the wing
                    area (hence units of kg per square meter).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>The polar curve for the 25-meter ASH-25 shows a sink rate of 2m/s at a flying speed of 200km/h
            (In imperial measures that's 3.9knots sink at 108knots) for a glide ratio of about 28:1.
        </p>
        <p>For comparison the polar curve below for the 18-meter ASW-29 shows it sinking at 1.75m/s at the
            same 200km/h flying speed, for a glide ratio of about 32:1. Counter-intuitively the cheaper
            smaller 18m sailplane is better at 200km/h than the ASH-25 25m sailplane. However, if
            conditions turn weak then the ASH-25 will win.

        <h2>Simulator sailplane polar design</h2>


        <h3>A note about units</h3>

        <p style="color: red">
        If you want your math to actually work, stick to SI units, i.e. "meters per second" for speeds (airspeed or sink),
        "meters" for distance (e.g. distance travelled or height gained or lost), "kilograms" for weight. The internal math
        has nothing to do with the number the needle on a cockpit gauge will point to, i.e. "meters" can trivially be converted
        to "feet" for the altimeter, or "meters per second" to "knots" or "kilometers per hour" for the ASI. Americans are
        have a track record of cluelessness in this regard so we end up with FSX speed simvars in a random mix of units
        (such as "feet per minute"
        and "knots", so be careful) and NASA has satellites off Mars crashing because force units of Slugs per Banjo or whatever were
        mixed up with Newtons.
        </p>

        <h3>Polar basics</h2>

        <img src="images/polar_basic_glider.png"/>

        <p>The basic sailplane polar is illustrated above. This is basically as 'advertised' by the manufacturer
        but you will see below this performance is actually one curve (the best) from an overlapping set of
        curves given different flight parameters. In still air, the glider sink rate is affected by at least the
        following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The design of the sailplane and wing.</b> Of course. This is what we represent in <tt>flight_model.cfg</tt>
            in the simulator.  The main parameters for a racing sailplane are
            minimum drag (i.e. a slippery shape) and an efficient wing (which mainly requires long wings with a maximum
            aspect ratio i.e. long and thin). Overall the objective is a high lift/drag <i>ratio</i>. Sailplanes achieve
            their ludicrously efficient flight performance by using <i>laminar flow</i> airfoils. Laminar flow is a bit like
            superconductivity in electricity - you move into a whole new realm of physics. The downside is if the airfoil
            moves outside its laminar flow regime (e.g approaches the stall, is plastered with dead insects) the performance
            nose-dives, sometimes literally.
            </li>
            <li><b>How heavily the glider is loaded.</b> This is typically described with the <i>wing loading</i> which is
            total weight divided by wing area. A typical high-performance glider may support wing-loadings from 36kg/m^2 to
            50kg/m^2 (and a standard class glider has a wing area of about 11m^2 so you can work out the weight ranges...).
            High wingloadings shift the polar down(more sink, unsurprisingly) and to the right (the glider flies faster). By
            a true miracle, the increase in both sink and airspeed actually (to a good approximation) keeps the <b>same
            best glide ratio</b> (see below). This means a racing glider will max out the permitted weight and attempt to
            zoom around the course with as little circling as possible. Weak conditions mean more circling in weak climbs and
            then the <i>minimum sink</i> of the glider becomes more important than <i>best glide ratio</i> and the
            extra ballast is a liability.
            </li>
            <li><b>The flap setting.</b> Positive flaps reduce the stall speed and increase lift and drag, negative flaps increase the
            stall speed and reduce lift and drag (in a sailplane). Given the <i>glide ratio</i> is equal to the Lift/Drag
            ratio of the sailplane, the $64,000 question is what the flaps do to the <i>overall</i> L/D ratio (hint: <b>all</b>
            the mainstream sims fail to consider the flaps can improve the efficiency of the whole wing, which is what happens
            in a sailplane).
            </li>
            <li><b>The angle of bank.</b> This increases the 'G', which as the effect of increasing the wing-loading (see
            above). Actually, the constant control inputs in circling flight (i.e. juggling the elevator and ailerons) have a
            side effect of reducing the overall efficiency also.
            </li>
            <li><b>Angle of attack</b>. E.g. as you pull up you temporarily increase the angle of attack of the main wing and
            a sailplane wing will lose performance during that manoever.
            </li>
            <li><b>Rain/bugs.</b>. As mentioned above, gliding airfoils are sensitive to these, some more than others.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wind.</b> All this discussion assumes testing in <i>still air</i> and the speeds are relative to the air
            in the 'box' the glider is flying in.  The best way to think about winds is to simply imagine that
            box is actually being carried across the countryside, sometimes quite quickly, but that doesn't
            affect the physics inside the box. (I'm quite proud to have flown 'backwards' in my gliding career). Flying
            into a headwind will cripple your glide slope over the ground, and a tail-wind will carry you as if on a
            magic carpet.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Some key speeds on the polar diagram</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Stall speed.</b> this is a fuzzily defined speed at which everything starts turning to crap. The main wing
            is at an angle of attack causing its lift efficiency to seriously suffer, and at the same time the main flight
            controls will be becoming less effective and feeling mushy. The main wing of an aircraft is <i>always</i> designed
            to stall before the tailplane so the effect will be for the nose to fall, hopefully resulting in a natural
            recovery. At low speeds the increase in the angle of attack as the wing falls is enough to make the situation worse
            and a full-on uncontrolled descent results. Sailplane wings are <i>much</i> more difficult near the stall
            than GA aircraft.
            </li>
            <li><b>Best glide ratio speed.</b> Sailplane performance near the stall is crap, and barrelling along at maximum speed is
            also burning energy, so somewhere between the two will be the speed the sailplane should fly at (in still air) to
            achieve the best glide ratio. For low wing-loading (e.g. an un-ballasted racing glider) this might be 55knots/100kph but
            with full ballast it could be 80knots/150kph. In still air this speed will give you the longest range over the ground,
            e.g. if you are tiptoeing home after a long flight and the day has died. In a race you will generally be flying much
            faster than this (and consequently coming down faster) but will compensate by selecting thermals of superb strength such
            that the fast flying pays off overall. Most racing pilots are much better at the first part than the second.
            </li>
            <li><b>Min sink speed</b>. This is not shown on the illustration above, but it is as described, i.e. the speed you
            need to fly at to come down the slowest. The rookie error is to assume this would be the optimum speed to fly around
            a course but that is wrong for all sorts of reasons of which the simplest is even the "best glide ratio speed" would be
            better, but even that has the handicap of slowness so you might not complete the course in the time available.
            </li>
            <li><b>V<sub>NE</sub></b>. Simply the "Never Exceed" speed, if you prefer wings attached to the aircraft.
            </li>

        <h3>The flaps effect on the polar</h3>

        <img src="images/polar_flaps.png"/>

        <p>In a flapped glider, the manufacture will still publish the 'polar', but that will actually be a best-performance
        composite of flying with the best flap setting for each speed segment, i.e. positive flaps at the low speed end, and
        negative flaps at the high speed end. The diagram above illustrates the multiple "flap polars" that combine to
        produce the best overall envelope (only three flap settings have been used for the illustration, in practice any
        flapped glider will have more).
        </p>
        <p>Typical flap settings for a sailplane might be described (ignoring actual flap degrees) as:
        </p>
        <p><b>L</b> - landing flap. An extreme positive flap setting with a low stall speed, high lift and high drag for a low speed
        controlled approach to a landing. These will typically have the aerodynamic effect of lowering the nose of the sailplane
        (at each airspeed) also. Designed assuming zero ballast as that is required to be dumped before any landing.
        </p>
        <p><b>+2</b> - thermalling flap for tight slow circling. Positive flap for slow circling in narrow thermals.
        </p>
        <p><b>+1</b> - thermalling flap for more gentle circling.
        </p>
        <p><b>0</b> - zero flap for max L/D.
        </p>
        <p><b>-1</b> - cruise flap (negative) for moderate speeds faster than best L/D.
        </p>
        <p><b>-2</b> - negative flap for racing speeds (e.g. 80knots/150kph +)
        </p>

        <p>You can see from the illustration above how the polar curve for each flap setting overlaps with the others, and the
        crossing points represent the optimal speeds to change flaps.
        </p>

        <p>It is the outermost <i>envelope</i> of the multiple flap polars which is used as the overall 'polar curve' for
        the aircraft.
        </p>

        <h3>Working with flight simulator flaps</h3>

        <img src="images/polar_sim_flaps.png"/>

        <p>The flap flight model implementations in FSX, X-Plane and (probably) MSFS model the flaps <i>separately</i>
        from the main wing. I.e. they are additional panels with their own lift/drag curves. For MSFS Asobo have made a great play
        of using the FSX flight model but increasing the number of panels that are (still independently) simulated.
        </p>

        <p>It seems the consequence of this modelling is that the effect of the flap setting on the overall aircraft polar is
        more consistent across the entire speed range, such that the flap polars do not intersect at any speed above the
        stall. This means the best glide performance is only available to the overall best flap setting (normally zero) at
        all speeds, and it makes sense to fly the entire flight at this flap setting.
        </p>

        <p>The simulated positive flap settings <i>do</i> lower the stall speed, so they make sense to use during a landing.
        </p>

        <p>In sailplanes, flaps are ultra-high-aspect-ratio airfoils (e.g. 10 meters long and 10cm wide) which also affect the
        aerodynamic properties of the main wing.
        </p>

        <p>Existing FSX, X-Plane, MSFS flaps work <i>great</i> for Cessnas and Airbuses with their 0..positive flap ranges and
        large square flap surfaces intended primarily for providing a very large increase in lift and drag (more than a sailplane
        landing flap).
        </p>

        <h3>Active flight control</h3>

        <i>Active flight control</i> for sim sailplanes is the automated micro-control of the spoilers to reduce glide performance
        where the simulator would be otherwise getting it wrong. This was first implemented on the Wolfgang Piper / B21
        <a href="https://xp-soaring.github.io/fsx/simobjects/ASH25V8/">ASH25</a> high-performance Open Class sailplane (see
        the b21_flaps_v4 gauge).

        <p>Flapped sim sailplanes without this active control would actually be best flown by setting the 'best' flap throughout the entire
        flight and the flaps are irrelevant for soaring. Much worse is the fact that most sim sailplanes can be flown at low speed in
        the wrong flap setting and achieve huge glide ratios (e.g. 100:1).

        <img src="images/polar_active_flight_control.png"/>

        <p>Using e.g. <tt>flight_model.cfg</tt> the sailplane can be modelled with (say) +2 flaps which give the correct glide at low
        speed, and (say) -2 flaps which give the correct glide for most of the polar curve above the max L/D speed.
        </p>

        <p>At this point the simulated -2 flap setting will be giving a better L/D ratio at slow speed than the +2 setting (i.e. the
        +2 setting is correct at low speed, but the -2 setting is wrong). We aim to correct the low-speed -2 flap error via active
        flight control, more below.
        </p>

        <p>The flightmodel 'degrees of flaps' used for these settings is <i>completely</i> independent of whatever is shown to the
        sim pilot, e.g. in labelling and moving the flap lever, or animating the flap deflection on the wings. For FSX and X-Plane it
        seems best to start with 0 degrees for -2, and move positive from there (while animating negative flap). The starting point
        may be an aircraft model which is animating directly on flap deflection degrees but that can be swapped for another simvar
        implemented specifically as part of the active flight control code.
        </p>

        <p>The automated adjustment is relatively simple. Gauge code (or other embedded code) can monitor the
        airspeed and flap setting (i.e. 'index')
        and use a lookup table/formula to control the 'spoiler handle position'.  Experimentation will show that the spoilers
        can be <i>cracked open</i> a small amount (try 1%) and that will be sufficient to bleed energy from the aircraft to correct
        the low-speed polar.
        </p>

        <h3>The effect of wingloading on the polar curve</h3>

        <img src="images/polar_ballast.png"/>

        <p>As above, increased weight in the sailplane will push the polar curve down and to the right, sliding along the
        'best L/D' line. In other words if a glider has a best glide ratio of 50 and ballast is added, then the ballasted glider
        will still have a best glide ratio of 50 but this will happen at a faster speed (and the sailplane will be sinking faster).
        </p>

        <p>For the actual polar shift <i>the increase in flying speed (and sink) is proportional to the square root of the increase
        in wing loading</i>. E.g. a glider with wing-area 10.8m, wing-loading 36kg/m^2 and best L/D at 56knots (my ASW24), if ballasted with
        150 liters of water (i.e. 150Kg/10.8m^2 = +13.9Kg/m^2) then the polar speed (and sink) increase is sqrt(49.9/36) = 1.18. So the new
        'best L/D' speed will be 56*1.18 = 66knots.
        </p>

        <p>Note: wing loading is simply a convenient way to refer to 'weight' which kinda normalises between different
        aircraft (of a similar type). As the the wing area doesn't typically change, adding 100kg
        of weight (ballast) to a sailplane with 10m^2 wing area is an increase in wing loading of 10kg/m^2 and you get used to the
        idea of the unballasted wing loading (say 35kg/m^2) or the max all-up wing loading (say 50kg/m^2) being broadly
        comparable among racing gliders although they may have different wing spans, masses, and wing areas.
        </p>
