<h1>sim_logger: FAI IGC file logger for Microsoft Flight Simulator (FSX)</h1>

<p>sim_logger will enable you to save an IGC-format tracklog file from within Microsoft Flight Simulator (FSX).
</p>
<p>Features include</p>
<ol>
<li>sim_logger saves an FAI-standard IGC file, recording the tracklog of your flight, both via a menu item and also automatically on FSX quit or an FSX crash. This file can be used by a variety of 3rd-party tools and websites.
</li>
<li>The IGC file itself has a checksum record which can be used to prove the content was entirely generated by sim_logger and has not otherwise been modified. sim_logger doubles up as a simple verifier tool to test the validity of these IGC files.
</li>
<li>sim_logger communicates with CumulusX, embedding a checksum for the current CumulusX settings file and also recording the locked/unlocked status of CumulusX. sim_logger also detects the user entering the 'weather settings' menu option during a flight.
</li>
<li>sim_logger embeds checksums for the current flight-performance-related files, e.g. the aircraft.cfg and the aircraft.air files, weather-related files, and also the mission xml file if one is loaded. An overall checksum-of-checksums is produced for a simple single check that all is as expected. If that checksum is wrong, the file can be viewed to see which source file (e.g. the FLT or the WX) was not as expected.
</li>
<li>sim_logger reads the currently loaded flight plan and embeds that plan as a declared task inside the IGC file, for convenience when analysing the trace in other software. e.g. for scoring.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks to Peter Funky Luerkens who provided the API to CumulusX and lots of advice on which features were most useful / possible to implement. Future users may be grateful that the "automatically save an IGC file if FSX crashes-to-desktop" was his idea, among many others.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>See readme in the zip.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once installed, sim_logger adds an Addon menu item Sim_logger->Save an IGC file.  If you click that, sim_logger
will save an IGC file in the folder specified in your exe.xml file (see installation instructions).
</p>

<p>To <i>check</i> the validity of a sim_logger IGC file, open a command window, navigate to the FSXBASE\Modules\sim_logger
folder (using the 'cd' command) and type 'sim_logger "igc file name"'.  E.g.
<pre>
<b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Modules\sim_logger></b>sim_logger.exe logs\B21_Task1_2009-10-09_1322.igc
</pre>

<h2>Sample IGC file</h2>
<p>This will give you an idea of what's in the file, if you're interested.</p>

<p>Good documentation on the format can be found on my 
<a href="http://carrier.csi.cam.ac.uk/forsterlewis/soaring/igc_file_format/">IGC file format homepage</a>.</p>
