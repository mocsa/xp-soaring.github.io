<h1>Setting up the waypoints in the GPS</h1>


<p>The GPS data is the .PLN file. When making a mission from scratch, you use the 
"Free Flight" mode in the game. Set all the parameters and save the flight to 
the name you want for the mission. It will generate the .FLT, .FFSAVE, .WX and .PLN file. 
It will only generate a .PLN file if you make a route. Do this by clicking on the "Flight Planner" 
button in Free Flight mode. It will ask you for a departure and destination airport. You can't set 
the same airport for departure and return. You can edit this in Notepad after making the file.
</p>

<p>Here's an example for a task flown from LOWZ (Zell am See) in Austria.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Set departure airport as LOWZ
</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Set destination airport as LOWI (Innsbruck), or something close, it really doesn't 
matter. After you set these airport the "Find Route" button will be active.
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Clisk on "Find route". You can now see a red line between the airports. 
Grab the line with your mouse and drag it close to your first waypoint. It 
will make a "WP1". Grab it again to make another waypoint for as many as you want.
</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Now save the file. It will default to a name like "VFR Zell Am Zee to XXX". 
I rename it to match the name of the mission.
</p>

<p><b>5.</b> After exiting out of the "flight planner" save the entire mission to the same 
name again. This way all your files for this mission, including the .PLN will have the same name.
</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Before moving these files, open the .PLN file in Notepad and copy and paste 
the departure data to replace the destination data for a round robin flight back 
to the airport. Look at it closely so you don't miss anything. You can also edit 
the waypoint data to match the lat/long data for the turnpoints POI's you 
have in the mission .xml. If you made extra waypoints other than the ones for POI's 
you can edit those too. Be sure to make a waypoint for the Start and Finish 
lines unless they are right over the airport.
</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Open the .FLT file and make sure the GPS data and file name match the .PLN data.
