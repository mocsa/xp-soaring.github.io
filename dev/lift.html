<h2><a name="goal"></a>What are we trying to achieve?</h2>

<p>The simplest lift is <b>ridge lift</b>, where the wind blows against a slope and is forced upwards.
Gliders (and birds) can fly in the area of updraft and stay aloft for hundreds of miles.  The great
thing about ridge lift is if it starts somewhere near your home airfield you can fly along it and still
get home, so long as the wind doesn't quit. The following pictures illustrate the ridge lift area
adjacent to the ridge, and a photograph taken from a real glider ridge soaring.</p>

<p>FSX has great tools for the creation of ridge lift in the mission editor, so you can design
ridgelift boxes working in a very realistic way.  Here's a screenshot within the Mission Editor
using a development visualisation model:

<tr>
  <td><img src="images/ridgelift_fsx.jpg"/></td>
</tr>

<p><b>Thermals</b> are a little more subtle.  The sun heats the ground, warms the air, which collects into
a bubble and rises in a column.  The left picture gives you the overview, while the right is an FSX
screenshot with the 'spiral' visual model enabled:

<h2><a name="realism"></a>Making your lift realistic</h2>

<p>It is a source of frustration for real glider pilots (well, me anyway) that lift in FSX is
usually so strong that every thermal would be in the Guinness Book of World Records.  The default
FSX thermal is 10+ knots to maybe 24,000 feet, and half-a-mile in diameter.  Frankly, you could fly
a surfboard in that kind of weather.</p>

<p>Here's a list of rules to make your thermals and ridge lift move realistic:</p>
<h4>Thermals:</h4>

<ol>
<li>A lift strength of 5-6 knots (2-3m/s)would be a good day in most of Europe or the eastern USA.</li>
<li>Make them the kind of diameter you can circle in, but not much larger.  I'll try and quantify this...</li>
<li>Thermals should <font color="red"><b>NOT</b></font> be designed to go above the cloudbase. Normal cross-country
flights involve climbs to cloudbase and no further.  Typical cloudbase in Europe and NE USA is 6000 feet.</li>
<li>Plant <b>more</b> thermals but make many of them weaker.  
Real gliding involves sampling and rejecting many more thermals.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Ridge lift:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Wind of 16-24 knots is good for ridge lift</li>
<li>Lift at ridgetop is typically 5 knots, so you can cruise at 100 knots without losing height.</li>
<li>Lift extends to 1000-2000 feet above the ridge but reduces in strength.  At 2000 feet above the ridge
you might be able to maintain height at best glide speed.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="AreaDefinition"></a>Defining the area for the ridgelift or the thermal in FSX</h2>
<h4>Area Definition Object</h4>

<p>Only one type of area definition is supported, RectangleArea, which
defines a 3D box. The edges of the box will not appear when the mission is being played. 
An Area Definition object contains the following properties:<br>

          lift (or sink) affecting the aircraft. The RectangleArea should be aligned with
          the slope of the adjacent ground.  For a south-<i>facing</i> slope this means a RectangleArea
          heading of 0. For a west-facing slope, the RectangleArea would have a heading of 90.

<h2><a name="ridgebox"></a>Practical ridgelift usage</h2>
<p>The simplest way to place ridgelift is to place the center over the apex of
the ridge. The stock AustrianSoaring mission uses this technique:</p>
  <img src="images/ridgelift2.jpg">

  <p>  More detailed control can be achieved using negative values for SinkRateScalar for lift in the entire box,
  and a similar technique to have the entire box produce sink on the leeward side:</p>
  <img src="images/ridgelift3.jpg">

<p>It is <b>crucial</b> that you understand the correct alignment of the RectangleArea with the
ridge and the wind.</p>

<h3>Ridgelift example</h3>

<p>The image below shows ridgelift placed on the north-facing slopes at Zell am See airfield in 
Austria (ICAO code LOWZ).</p>

<p>The ridge areas in this example are all 1000 meters high, 4000 meters long (East-West), and
2000 meters wide (North-South). The ridge areas all have a heading of 180, and on the lower slopes have been tilted upwards
about 30 degrees (i.e. orientation 330,0,180). A ridgebox scenery object (see below) has been used to illustrate
the position of the boxes.  Note that the lower ridgeboxes have <b>negative</b> SinkRateScalar values (-0.8), which with the
<b>positive</b> CoreRateScalar values (+0.8) ensures the lower boxes entirely contain <b>lift</b>. The wind in the mission is set
to 16 knots from 45 degrees, i.e. 45 degrees clockwise from the expected optimal to mitigate a current FSX bug.

<p>This download contains a simple mission (with no waypoints or goal!) purely to allow you to slew and fly around
a series of ridgeboxes to gain a better understanding of the way ridgelift in FSX works. If you check the 'allow changes'
checkbox on the FSX missions page before loading the mission, you can change the wind strength and direction and see
the effect.  This mission was used to calibrate the charts above.

<h2><a name="LiftGotchas"></a>Common problems creating lift in FSX</h2>

<ul>
  <li>set <b>wind</b> in the current weather. Otherwise there will be no ridge lift.  Real ridges are
  generally good with 16-24 knots wind.<br/><br/></li>
  
  <li>Align the RectangleArea correctly relative to the wind. If the wind is from the North (heading 0), the 
  RectangleArea heading would be 180 (but <b>see next item</b>), and you'd 
  expect it to be on a north-facing slope (note FSX ridgelift is purely dependent upon the orientation
  of the <i>RectangleArea</i>, the shape/slope of the nearby terrain is irrelevant.)<br/><br/></li>
  
  <li>As of Jan 07, an FSX bug rotates the required wind to generate maximum lift clockwise 90 degrees.  As
  a workaround, set your wind to <b>45 degrees clockwise</b> to the expected perpendicular alignment to the 
  slope/ridgebox.  I.e. on a north-facing slope, set the heading of the RectangleArea to 180 (so it correctly
  points into the slope), and the wind to 45 degrees. This workaround will generate about three-quarters of
  the expected lift, so the ridgeboxes will behave similarly if/when the bug is fixed.<br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li>Set the CoreRateScalar value correctly.  For wind 45 degrees clockwise from into the slope, the lift
  will be 0.75 times the windspeed times the CoreRateScalar. (When the bug's fixed it should be simply
  windspeed times CoreRateScalar).  So with <font color='green'><b>16 knots wind at 45 degrees</b></font>,
   and a <font color='green'><b>RectangleArea with heading
  180</b></font>, and an embedded RidgeLift object with a <font color='green'><b>CoreRateScalar of 0.8</b></font>
  , the lift should be 0.75 x 16 x 0.8,
  i.e. <font color='green'><b>7.2 knots</b></font>.<br/><br/>
  </li>
