    <h2 align='center'>The Austrian Soaring Competition</h2>
    <p>These missions are successive competition days following on from the original "Austrian
    Alpine Soaring Course" mission provided with FSX Deluxe.  The missions generally have an area
    height restriction of 9000 feet, and the thermal and ridge lift is far more detailed than the
    FSX original.</p>
    <p>The missions will be best enjoyed if played in the chronological order.  Any pilot should be
    able to complete all the missions, but getting the best time requires more skill as the days
    progress.

      <p>A 206 km flat triangle from Zell am See airfield in Austria, the same setting as the
         stock FSX soaring mission.  The course takes you along the valley 70 km to the 
         West of LOWZ before returning past the airfield another 35 km to the East, and then home.</p>
      <p>Much of the task is a ridge run, with the wind 16 knots from the North-east giving good
         ridge lift on the south side of the valley.

      <p><b>Author:</b> <font color="green"><b>B21</b></font></p>
      <p><b>Time target:</b> 1 hour 15 minutes</p>
      <p>Day 3 in the Austrian Soaring competition, with the wind still blowing from the North-East.
         The task set for the day is a 172 km quadrilateral from Zell am See airfield in Austria, involving
         both ridge and thermal soaring. 50 competitor gliders are simulated on the course.</p>
      <p>The first challenge is to reach Turnpoint 1, in a valley to the
         South-East of the airfield.  With a North-Easterly wind the ridges on the South and West sides of the
         valleys are giving lift, but traversing high ground can be dangerous unless you make sure of a 
         safe exit to an area of known lift.</p>
         
      <p>After TP1 you follow the valley back North, with an into-wind leg to reach the second turnpoint.
         Immediately after TP2 it is decision time, to plan your route over or around the high ground on
         your path to the third and final turnpoint.</p>

      <p><b>Author:</b> <font color="green"><b>B21</b></font></p>
      <p><b>Time target:</b> 1 hour 15 minutes</p>
      <p>Day 4 in the Austrian Soaring competition, with the wind still blowing from the North-East but
         reduced from yesterday, now 8 knots.
         The task set for the day is a 160 km quadrilateral from Zell am See airfield in Austria, involving
         both ridge and thermal soaring.</p>
      <p>The first challenge is to reach Turnpoint 1, 40km along the valley to the
         West of the airfield.  With the North-Easterly wind the ridges on the South side of the
         valleys are giving lift and thermals kicked off the high ground are plentiful.</p>
         
      <p>After TP1 you turn North, with an into-wind leg to reach the second turnpoint. The first part of
         this leg requires you pass over the ridge on the North side of the valley, and this will require
         careful flying due to the expected curl-over from the ridge.
         After TP2 you must plan your route over or around the high ground on
         your path to the third and final turnpoint. Then you should try and optimise the final glide for home,
         passing over the large
         lake to the North of LOWZ airport.</p>

      <p>In this mission, you´ll fly a Discus 2b standard class glider around a course in the 
      European Alps. You start the mission at Dornbirn Airfield by a tow. Fly the four Turnpoints and 
      make a safely landing at Dornbirn Airfield.
      </p>
      <p>Today, it´s a beautifull Soaring Day - good Thermals, Ridge Lifts and also 
      some waves are around the course.

      <p>The mission zip file includes the Shempp-Hirth Discus 2b from Wolfgang Piper, also

    <h2 align='center'>The Mifflin Soaring Competition</h2>
    <p>If you enjoyed the FSX Deluxe "Austrian Soaring" mission, and the follow-on missions
    available for download here, then this package moves things to the next simulation generation.</p>
    <p>The missions will be best enjoyed if played in the chronological order.  Day 1 is a good start
    to the competition which most pilots should be able to complete fairly easily, but the later missions
    require concentration and stamina.  Day 5 in particular is a 531km 4-hour marathon for which completion
    is an achievement in itself.
    </p>
    <p>The tasks of each of the days overlaid onto the same map can be found below</p>
      <p>A <a href="mifflin/overview.htm"><b>detailed briefing document is available</b></a>.  You will need to study
      this carefully, <b>and print out the maps</b> to successfully fly the missions.
