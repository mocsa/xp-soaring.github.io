time to save everything. Click “Save” and save this “flight” as the same

<p><b>4. Now we will do some editing

find all your .FLT, FSSave, .WX and .PLN files.</b></p>

</span></span>Below is what the file looks like for this mission.&nbsp; I used
WORD instead of notepad so I could high light all the destination airport data<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

airport. Just copy and paste all the identifier and lat./long. data from the
departure to destination.</b></p>

<p
><b><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b>5. Now we check our work. Open the game back up and go
to “Free Flight” and load the mission (Mine is SWHouston).</b></p>

&nbsp;</o:p>

<p><b>6. Click on “Flight Planner” and you should see the
departure and destination airports being the same. <font size="4" color="#FF0000">DO
NOT click on “Find Route”!</font> If you do you won’t see your flight
plan. You can reload it again though. Instead, click on the “Edit” tab on
the top. We now see our flight plan departing and returning to the same airport.
You can edit the waypoints again if you want, or add more at this time. You
cannot edit waypoints that are airports or intersections. Only waypoints that
are named Wp1, WP2, etc.. Just be sure to <font color="#FF0000" size="4">save</font>
the file to the same name again.</b></p>

&nbsp;</o:p>
</b></p>
<p><b>7. Exit out and be sure SAVE the “flight” AGAIN to
the same name. This will make a change to the .FLT file so it will see the
correct GPS data and it will sync to the .FLT file.</b></p>
<p><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span><b>You
might want to go ahead and actually fly the mission just to make sure it’s all
loaded and synchronized properly.</b></p>
<p><b>8. You now have the .FLT and .PLN files matched with the GPS.</b></p>
