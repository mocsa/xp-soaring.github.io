<p>Update notes for this release: 2.31 is a BUGFIX release for non-English FSX users to allow save of un-verified IGC tracklogs (i.e. where the
logging didn't start with the load of a saved flight). If you already have sim_logger versions 2.28 or newer, version 2.31 can be installed as
an <i>upgrade</i> by dragging just <tt>sim_logger.exe</tt> from the <tt>Modules\sim_logger\exe</tt> in the zip into the matching folder in your
FSX installation.
</p>

<p>(further release info see <a href="release_notes.html">Release notes</a>)</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Sim_logger can both <b>save</b> and <b>automatically replay</b> IGC-format tracklog files in FSX. 
Sim_logger is installed as an add-on module to FSX, and appears entirely under the 'Add-ons' menu within
a flight. The installation of sim_logger is a simple drag-and-drop into the 'Modules' folder of FSX, plus a
double-click on a command file to update FSX's 'exe.xml' startup config file.
</p>

<p>There are really <i>three</i> usage scenarios involving sim_logger:
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Using sim_logger to record a secure IGC-format GPS tracklog showing the timestamped route of the user aircraft.</b>
</li>
<li><b>Finding and analyzing IGC logs to check their security and confirm the route taken around waypoints, start/finish times, and
other flight information.</b>
</li>
<li><b>Using sim_logger to replay IGC tracklog files within FSX.</b>
</li>
</ol>

<p>After <a href="#installation">installing sim_logger</a>, FSX will have an "Add-on->Sim_logger" menu, on which
the most important menu option is "SAVE an IGC tracklog file now...". This will save the tracklog up to the current point.
</p>
<p>Please note that sim_logger is <b>always</b> recording an internal log of your flight, right from the moment you
first load a flight or start a mission. So you only need a menu option to <b>SAVE</b> your tracklog. Sim_logger restarts
the tracklog every time it detects you load a new flight...
</p>
<p>To have a better understanding of what sim_logger is <a href="#advantages">good at</a> and 
<a href="#limitations">not so good</a> at, it is worth noting that sim_logger
only records the position of the user aircraft (latitude, longitude, altitude) every four seconds, which is consistent with
writing an <a href="http://carrier.csi.cam.ac.uk/forsterlewis/soaring/igc_file_format/">IGC-format</a> tracklog file. The main
pluses of this approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the module imposes negligible workload on FSX and</li>
<li> that the files are compatible with real-life
tracklog software nothing to do with FSX (e.g. the website 
<a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=26915">www.everytrail.com</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p> The downside is a lot of information
is <i>not</i> recorded, e.g. undercarriage position - if your goal is to make an animated movie showing up-close aircraft
traffic, you should look at the excellent freeware <a href="http://www.fs-recorder.net">fs-recorder</a>.
</p>

<p>Here's the view from the cockpit when a few other tracklogs are being replayed:
</p>

<h2>A sample flight to demonstrate the replay capability</h2>

<p>Sim_logger V2 includes a sample flight "Schuylkill County Ridge Run" with a
dozen associated IGC tracklog files. If you simply load that flight, select an aircraft
while paused at the start (or stay with the default DG808S), unpause, and wait a couple
of seconds, you will see the fleet of gliders take off in front of you.  Hit Control-Shift-Y
for an aerotow to follow them, and try and complete the cross-country flight to
Mifflintown yourself. Maximum launch height 3000 feet, then the basic trick is to dive for the
ridge (follow the planes in front!) and ridge run to the Susquahanna River. You need to
slow up before the river to gain enough height to make the upwind ridge on the way to
Mifflintown. Here's the view during the aerotow:
</p>

<h3>Another sample, this time with <i>real</i> IGC tracklogs</h3>

<p>I've created a <a href="wgc-lusse-day3">screenshot walkthrough of sim_logger replay of Day 3 of the 2008 World Gliding
Championships</a> which will illustrate what the Version 2 replay capabilities are. The competition had 46 gliders all flying the
same task, and I've included the real IGC files in the sim_logger version 2 zip file.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>Installation is simple (drag and drop of one folder) but you must <a href="#installation"><b>disable aircraft collisions</b></a> in the FSX
menus or you will typically collide with a tracklog of your own previous saved flight the instant you start a new
one...
</p>

<p>Once installed in FSX, usage of sim_logger both for record and replay of IGC tracklog files is fairly
simple (i.e. the features are actually fairly basic).
</p>

<ol>
<li>Load a flight of your choice, preferably (but not necessarily) with an associated flightplan.</li>
<li>Fly around the task and land at the destination airport</li>
<li><b>Before</b> you quit the flight in FSX, click "Addon->Sim_logger->SAVE IGC tracklog file now".</li>
</ol>

<p>A confirmation message will scroll across the top of the screen and
your IGC tracklog will now be stored in a sub-folder of the folder the original flight file was loaded from.
Now you can exit the flight, or indeed FSX, and the tracklog file will have been safely stored.
</p>

<p>By default, FSX stores flight files (e.g. "My Flight.FLT") in the<br/>
 <tt>"My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files\"<br/></tt>
folder. Hence by default, for that flight, sim_logger will store the IGC tracklog file in<br/>
 <tt>"My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files\My Flight\&lt;id&gt;_My Flight_&lt;datetime&gt;.igc"</tt><br/>
 where &lt;id&gt; is the tail number of the aircraft you're flying and &lt;datetime&gt; is YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM. E.g. a real
 example from my computer is:<br/>
 <tt>"My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files\Task 2\B21_Task 2_2009-11-11_1922.igc"</tt><br/>
 </p>

<h3>Explanation of the sim_logger Add-On menu</h3>

<p><b>SAVE an IGC tracklog file now.</b>  This will store an IGC tracklog file of the recorded flight
in your "Flight Simulator X Files" folder in a sub-folder with the same name as the currently loaded
flight.
</p>

<p><b>RESTART tracklog from here.</b> This has the effect of trimming of your flight up until now in any
tracklog you subsequently save. This is useful if you want to slew to a new position before the tracklog starts,
and then start logging.  By default, sim_logger will be logging the position of your aircraft from the moment the
flight loads.
</p>

<p><b>Manage tracklog files.</b> This is where you can see within FSX the tracklogs associated with the currently
loaded flight.  If you open "My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files" in Windows Explorer and navigate to the sub-folder
with the same name as the currently loaded flight, you will see the same files.  More information 
with screenshots is given in the
section following.
</p>

<p><b>ENABLE/DISABLE tracklog replay.</b> Thanks to Peter Luerkens for suggesting this menu option... this
will turn off (or back on) the automatic replay of stored IGC tracklogs.
</p>

<h3>Managing tracklogs</h3>

<p>If now or in the future you load the same flight (use the <i>Load...</i> button on the "Free Flight" menu),
then sim_logger will <i>automatically</i> load any IGC tracklog files it finds in the named sub-folder, and 
replay those logs in FSX.
</p>

<p><i>If</i> you find the automatic replay of previously saved IGC files annoying, or just not what you want,
there are a few mechanisms that give you some control over what's happening.
</p>

<p>The <i>simplest</i> process to use to prevent a saved IGC file replaying is to use the 
"Add-on->Sim_logger->Manage tracklogs for current flight" menu item, which will list the tracklogs
that sim_logger is auto-loading <i>for the current flight</i>.</p>

<img src="images/manage_tracklogs.jpg" alt="Manage your tracklogs for the current flight via FSX menus"/>

<p>Here you can select the tracklog you want to manage - either click the keyboard key corresponding to the 
tracklog file you want, or click on that row in the menu with your mouse. 
</p>

<h3>Viewing the properties of a tracklog (Tracklog Info)</h3>

<p>When you've clicked on the filename in the "Select File to Manage" window, the following "Tracklog Info"
menu will appear.
</p>

<img src="images/tracklog_detail.jpg" alt="Look at the summary data for a selected tracklog"/>

<p>In this "Tracklog Info" page, you can see more information about that particular tracklog.</p>

<p>For soaring use, the important lines are 3 & 4, and this isn't a great example because sim_logger is
saying it "could not verify this tracklog" which means the file content does not match the general
checksum, so you cannot rely on the content of the file in any way. (Apologies, that was me manually tweaking
the file during testing). If line 3 says 'verified OK' and line 4 matches the overall checksum expected for
the combination of files, then you don't have a need to look at 'DETAIL checksums' at all.
</p>

<p>To prevent the tracklog auto-loading when the current flight is loaded, choose option 
'8 - DISABLE this tracklog from sim_logger replay'.  The tracklog will still appear in the list shown before, but
will not auto-load. For the Windows-savvy amongst you, this feature is implemented simply by renaming the IGC file,
embedding [X] before the '.igc', so a filename "B21_My Flight_2009-11-11_1233.igc" becomes 
"B21_My Flight_2009-11-11_1233[X].igc".</p>

<p>If a tracklog file is 'disabled' for replay, the disable menu option changes to 'ENABLE' which has
the reverse effect to that described above.
</p>

<p>You can also remove the IGC tracklog from the 'auto-play' function by simply moving the file <i>out</i> of 
the sub-folder using Windows Explorer.
</p>

<p>Note you can <i>add</i> additional IGC tracklog files to auto-play simply by dragging them <i>into</i>
the log folder for that particular flight.
</p>

<h3>Checking the Checksums</h3>

<p>Assuming you have "verified OK" on the previous page, you can see greater detail on the checksums of
the various files involved via the Checksum Detail window.
</p>

<p>A significant feature of sim_logger is for gliding use, storing encrypted checksums in approved spaces
within the IGC file. Option '7. - DETAIL checksums for this tracklog' displays the checksums and other
status fields embedded within the IGC file, so you can be confident pilots within FSX are flying in
the same conditions.</p>

<img src="images/checksum_detail.jpg" alt="Look at the detail checksums embedded within a chosen tracklog"/>

<p>Beyond the basic checksum concept that ensures the weather and aircraft performance files were as expected when
the tracklog was saved, for soaring use an important record is line 5, <b>FSX Thermals Removed OK</b>. For soaring in
FSX you should install <a href="http://luerkens.homepage.t-online.de/peter/">the freeware CumulusX! from Peter Luerkens</a>.
</p>

<h3>More detail, for sharing flights with others</h3>

<p>If you download an IGC file from elsewhere, you can copy it to a suitable folder with the same
name as a loadable flight (e.g. into a "My Documents\Flight Simulator X Files\&lt;flight name&gt;\" folder) and then when
you load that flight the IGC file will be
automatically loaded.
</p>

<p>If the IGC file was originally created by sim_logger, you can then check the validity of the various checksums via
the FSX Add-ons menu as described above. </p>

<p>If you are familiar with the Windows "Command Window", you can also <i>check the validity</i> of a sim_logger IGC file:
</p>
<ol>
<li>open a command window, </li>
<li>navigate to the FSXBASE\Modules\sim_logger folder (using the 'cd' command) and</li>
<li>type 'sim_logger "igc file name"'.  E.g.

<pre>
<b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Modules\sim_logger></b><font color=green>sim_logger logs\B21_Task1_2009-10-09_1322.igc</font>
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="advantages"></a>Advantages of sim_logger</h2>

<p>Sim_logger is optimised for the use of FAI-standard 
<a href="http://carrier.csi.cam.ac.uk/forsterlewis/soaring/igc_file_format/">IGC-format tracklog files</a>.
</p>

<p>This means saved tracklog files can be viewed in a variety of real-life soaring software packages out
there, e.g. the comprehensive (payware) soaring analysis package SeeYou, or the (free) tracklog sharing website
<a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=26915">www.everytrail.com</a>.
</p>

<p>IGC files can also be converted for display in Google Earth either via the everytrail site mentioned
above or with more functionality <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input?form=googleearth">gpsvisualizer.com</a>.
</p>

<p>The fact that the IGC-format files only contain very limited data (time-latitude-longitude-altitude) and
the sampling interval is expected to be quite long, e.g. every four seconds, the sampling and saving method is
<i>very efficient</i>. This has the benefit that sim_logger is designed to <i>always</i> record an internal
log of your flight, awaiting the pilot clicking the 'save' option to keep it for posterity. The background
workload in making the recording is also insignificant which is helpful in getting the maximum framerate in FSX.
Note that a multi-hour tracklog might only be 100KB or so.<p>

<p>For replay, a similar efficient technique has been used, with the AI aircraft being updated once-per-second to be
slewed (on a curved path) between the four-second sample intervals. This means <i>hundreds</i> of IGC tracklogs can potentially be
replayed concurrently, e.g. the replay of the entire field of a real-life 60-entry competition soaring task. In my
testing the performance limit comes from the graphics of the AI models displayed rather than the replay technique.</p>

<p>In general other approaches to animating aircraft within FSX have assumed detailed position control of 
each AI object on a
<i>per-visual-frame</i> basis (e.g. 30 times each second) which can imply greater overhead in controlling the
AI objects and potentially much larger tracklog storage requirements for the rapid lat-long-alt-pitch-bank-heading-velocity samples.
</p>

<h2><a name="limitations"></a>What sim_logger doesn't do</h2>

<p>To understand the limitation of sim_logger, you just have to be aware that the information recorded during
normal flight is Time-Latitude-Longitude-Altitude-EngineNoise, at four-second intervals.<p>

<p>The top part of the IGC log file can record a load of ancilliary information, like flight plan, aircraft type and pilot
name, but the regularly recorded time-series stuff is those five values only.</p>

<p>This means that the IGC tracklog file is great for flight <i>verification</i> but is pretty limited if you want to
replay the flight from that data.</p>

<p>For flight <i>replay</i>, sim_logger necessarily <i>interpolates</i> beween the four-second lat/long/alt samples to move
an AI aircraft along an estimation of the original flightpath, and sim_logger <i>calculates</i> suitable pitch/bank/heading
values from the original position data.</p>

<p>I hope it is clear from this approach that aerobatic manoevers like rolls or sideslips are <i>completely invisible</i> to sim_logger
because bank and heading are simply not recorded in the IGC tracklog data. Your lat/long/alt values along a flightpath are the same whether
you are doing a roll or not...
</p>

<p>There is a <i>great</i> solution for you if you want to record the exact motion of an aircraft, including the various animations of
undercarriage, flaps etc. That is <a href="http://www.fs-recorder.net/">the freeware fs-recorder from Matthias Neusinger</a>.

          <p>If you are *not* using CumulusX for your thermals (e.g. Active Sky):</p>

          <p>Please be aware sim_logger will DISABLE FSX THERMALS by default, on the 
          assumption that CumulusX is being used for thermals.  A sim_logger.ini
          file setting (disable_fsx_thermals = false) (see step 6) will ensure
          sim_logger leaves your FSX thermals in place. The default value
          (disable_fsx_thermals = true) means sim_logger will rename your

        this already.
        </li>

<li>DOUBLE-CLICK the vcredist_x86.exe in the ZIP file, or

       This will install the Microsoft VC++ Runtime needed for the module,
       and is safe to install even if you already have it.
</li>
<li>DRAG the 'Modules' folder from this ZIP file into your FSXBASE
        folder (e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X").<br/>
        The 'Modules' folder should already exist but this will put the
        new 'sim_logger' add-on module in there.
</li>
<li>DRAG the 'Flight Simulator X Files' folder from this ZIP into
        your "My Documents" folder. The folder should already exist but
        this step will put some new flights in that folder.
</li>
<li>OPEN Windows Explorer and navigate to the new "FSXBASE\Modules\sim_logger" folder.<br/>
        DOUBLE-CLICK on the UPDATE_XML.cmd file.<br/>
        This will create the appropriate entry in your "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\FSX\exe.xml"
        file, to include the sim_logger add-on automatically at FSX startup
        (<a href="images/UPDATE_XML_non_found.png">screenshot</a>).
</li>
<li>(optional). You can EDIT the 'Modules\sim_logger\sim_logger.ini' file to
        change the language used for the menus (we currently have en, de, nl) and
        to preset your 'Glider ID' (pick 3 letters or numbers) and 'Pilot Name'
        (<a href="sim_logger_ini.txt">view sim_connect.ini file sample</a>).
        </li>
<li>Start FSX, and in "Settings->Realism" in the "Crashes and damage" section<br/>
        UNCHECK "allow collisions with other aircraft" 
        (<a href="images/allow_collisions.jpg">screenshot</a>).<br/>
        If you don't do this, your user aircraft will IMMEDIATELY collide with any
        aircraft loaded from a prior saved tracklog.<br/>
        See screenshot in 'Configuring FSX' below.
</li>
<li>For soaring in
FSX you should install <a href="http://luerkens.homepage.t-online.de/peter/">the freeware CumulusX! from Peter Luerkens</a>.
</li>

</ol>
THAT'S IT!

<p>To confirm sim_logger is installed simply start FSX and load any flight, and you
should see a Add-Ons->Sim_logger sub-menu.
</p>

<h3>Configuring FSX</h3>

<p>Go into your FSX 'Realism' settings and <i>uncheck</i> the box that says "allow collisions" as illustrated below. This
will prevent a previously saved tracklog file from immediately colliding with you when you start the flight.
</p>
<img src="images/allow_collisions.jpg" alt="you need to turn OFF collisions if you replay tracklogs"/>

<p>If you are going to replay IGC tracklog files from <i>other</i> pilots, it is worth going into your settings
menu and adjusting the 'red' displayed information above the AI aircraft to show just the tail number. Note that sim_logger
will embed the actual tail number of the original user into the IGC tracklog file, so you can more easily identify
who is who when you're flying in this effective 'offline multi-player' mode.
</p>

<img src="images/aircraft_labels.jpg" alt="FSX can show aircraft labels, and these are stored in the tracklogs"/>

<h2><a name="ini"></a>Modules\sim_logger\sim_logger.ini</h2>

<p>The ini file included with sim_logger gives you a satisfactory working configuration. After you are comfortable that
sim_logger is installed correctly you can edit this file with Notepad or something similar to set a few minor items such
as a default "Pilot Name" to be included in the IGC tracklog files.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, if the constant replay of flight files by sim_logger is inconvenient for you, you
can place entries in the sim_logger.ini file that stop the auto-replay of stored flights.</p>

<p>Full instructions are included as comments within the sim_logger.ini file.
</p>

<h2>Sample IGC file</h2>
<p>This will give you an idea of what's in the saved tracklog file, if you're interested.</p>

<p>Good documentation on the format can be found on my 
<a href="http://carrier.csi.cam.ac.uk/forsterlewis/soaring/igc_file_format/">IGC file format homepage</a>.</p>

<li>FSX simconnect message handling, in particular recognising file loads of FLT, PLN, WX files and
receiving the position updates from the user aircraft and the replaying AI objects</li>
<li>Writing the IGC file for the user aircraft.  The checksum formula has been removed to keep it
secure.</li>
<li>Reading the IGC files associated with the loaded flight, adding interpolated points if the sample rate
is a bit low, and estimating values for pitch, bank and heading (these are not in the log).</li>
<li>The AI movement algorithm, updating the slew rates of the AI objects once-per-second.</li>
<li>The menu system using the FSX SimConnect_Text call</li>
</ul>

<p>If you <i>disable</i> the sim_logger load in your exe.xml (e.g. rename the Modules\sim_logger folder),
you can start FSX, open a command window and type "sim_logger debug", and sim_logger will echo to the console 
variety of debugging status information as it executes.

<p><a href="http://www.forum.aerosoft.com/index.php?showforum=161">The SOAR forums</a> are probably the best place to start
if you have questions about sim soaring. Support for both sim_logger and CumulusX are there also.

<p><a href="../downloads/CAI/CAI_Instl.exe">Cambridge Aero Explorer Plus</a> (<a href="../downloads/CAI/aero_expV1.0.pdf">manual</a>). This seems
to me to be far and away the best free Windows client for viewing and analysing IGC tracklog files. Plus multiple tracklog files can be
animated together to see everyone flying around a task. The orginal exe can be found at <a href="http://www.gfbyars.com/winscore/">Guy Byar's 
winscore site</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.fs-recorder.net">fs-recorder</a> - records and replays flights within FSX, including a large range
of FSX detail features. fs-recorder uses a proprietary tracklog file storage format so you can't use the files for anything
else, but the technique is optimised for use within FSX so the program is great for creating animated movies in FSX.
