release notes

<h1>Sim_logger release notes</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>2.31</b> BUGFIX for non-English FSX for unverified IGC file saves to<br/>
  <center>&lt;user documents&gt;\&lt;local language FSX Files folder&gt;\sim_logger_unverified_logs<br/></center>
  from the hard-coded 'Flight Simulator X Files' used in 2.30 (ok in English, broken elsewhere).
  </li>

<li><b>2.30</b> Changed the default folder for unverified IGC file saves to<br/>
  <center>(My) Documents\Flight Simulator X Files\sim_logger_unverified_logs<br/></center>
  from the FSXBASE sub-folder used in 2.29 which clashed with Vista/Win7 security.
  </li>

<li><b>2.29</b> Fix for Plan-G flightplan files - these can now be read successfully so the task can be
  included in the tracklog (there was a unicode incompatibility with prior versions of sim_logger).<br/>
  To provide better support for logging in 'free flight', these tracklogs will be saved in
  FSXBASE\Modules\sim_logger\free_flight_logs. With previous versions of sim_logger, these tracklogs may
  have been discarded.
  </li>

<li><b>2.27</b> Modified 'Restart tracklog from here' menu option so that the 'flight start time'
  used in the tracklog filename is updated to the current time that option was selected.  This means
  a subsequent tracklog save on the same flight will not overwrite earlier saved tracklogs.
  </li>
<li><b>2.26</b> Added an 'enable/disable autosave' option to the sim_connect.ini file, so that the automatic
  save of IGC tracklogs can be disabled (e.g. after an aircraft crash, FSX crash-to-desktop, or the end of a flight longer
  than 20 minutes that has not been saved)
  </li>
<li><b>2.25</b> First production version 2, with improved recording of FSX soaring-related checksums, and a
  'replay' function for previously saved IGC tracklog files.
  </li>
<li><b>1.18</b> Final production version 1, saving FSX aircraft tracklog to an IGC-format file including
  some FSX checksums.
  </li>
</ul>
