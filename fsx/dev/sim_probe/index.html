<h1>sim_probe: Simulation of ridge lift in Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX)</h1>

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><font color=red><b>Mid 2009: dynamically created ridgelift is now a built-in feature of
<a href="http://luerkens.homepage.t-online.de/peter/">CumulusX!</a>
 from Peter Luerkens, and my sim_probe module is now redundant.</b></font><br/>
   If you have sim_probe installed, you should upgrade to the latest version of
   <a href="http://luerkens.homepage.t-online.de/peter/">CumulusX!</a> and uninstall
   sim_probe. The <i>logging</i> capability of sim_probe is now available in a new
   freeware module called son-of-sim_probe... ok it's really called <a href="../sim_logger">sim_logger</a>.
   </p>
<li><p><b>June 2008:  sim-probe 3.00 announced. Now automatically saves IGC log files</b><br/>
   sim_probe has been extended to have an automatic IGC file logging capability. This
   creates a lat/long/time trace of every flight in the standard IGC format, that can be
   viewed by a variety of freeware and commercial IGC file analysis programs. See the
   README for sim-probe version 3.00 for more details.

<h2>Ridge lift in FSX - The basic idea</h2>

<p>Using the FSX programmable API called simconnect, <i>sim_probe</i> can sample the terrain
around the users aircraft and with the prevailing wind calculate the appropriate lift factor
to apply to the user aircraft.
</p>

<p>The end result is continuously variable highly detailed lift and sink affecting the user aircraft
increasing the reality of the user experience.  For ridge-soaring flights in gliders the sense of 
the lift within the flight simulator is almost tactile.

    <p>By sampling the ground elevation of the terrain in a windward direction relative to the
    current position of the user aircraft, an appropriate value of applicable topographic lift
    can be calculated.  The technique is highly efficient for flight simulator
    use as only the lift at the current location
    of the user aircraft needs to be calculated. With a small number of ground elevation sample
    points, highly detailed topographic lift can be simulated.
