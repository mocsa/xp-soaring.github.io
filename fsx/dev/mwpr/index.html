<h1>FSX Soaring Mission Development - Mission WayPoint Randomizer</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mission WayPoint Randomizer (mwpr.exe) reads IN a mission xml file (e.g. MyMission.xml), scans for the
waypoints contained within Moving Scenery Objects, ADJUSTS them by random amounts within lat/long/altitude 
ranges defined in mwpr.cfg and
writes OUT a new mission xml file (MyMission_adj.xml).
</p>

<p>The point is to assist in the creation of large numbers of moving scenery objects, without them all robotically
following the exact same path.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create ONE moving scenery object in your mission</li>
<li>Add all the waypoints you want this object to follow</li>
<li>COPY that moving scenery object within the Object Placement Tool as many times as you wish</li>
<li>SAVE the mission xml file (e.g. as MyMission.xml)</li>
<li>Either from within the Object Placement Tool, or by manually editting the mission xml file, ADJUST
the starting WorldPositions of each mobile scenery object.  If you don't do this, all your objects will start
from exactly the same place, and follow exactly the same path, so in the next trial step you will only see one
object.</li>
<li>At this point if you re-run your mission in FSX you should see the multiple moving scenery objects, but
all will be following the exact same path</li>
<li>COPY the mwpr.cfg file from the mwpr folder into your mission folder containing your mission xml file</li>
<li>EDIT this copy of the mwpr.cfg file with the lat/long/altitude ranges you want to allow</li>
<li>DRAG AND DROP your mission xml file over the mwpr.exe icon in the mwpr folder</li>
<li>mwpr will create a new mission xml file in &lt;yourname&gt;_adj.xml (e.g. MyMission_adj.xml),
and a log file called mwpr.log in your mission source folder</li>
<li>Rename your original mission xml file, e.g. MyMission_original.xml, and rename the adjusted file
to MyMission.xml</li>
<li>Reload your mission in FSX (i.e. you will be loading the adjusted xml file), and you should see the
multiple mobile scenery objects following slightly different paths</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage hints</h2>
<ol>
<li>The mwpr.exe tool is designed to be used 'drag and drop' within Windows Explorer, although it can be run
from the command line, with the input file as the first parameter</li>
<li>mwpr.exe looks in the mission folder first for a mwpr.cfg file.  If it doesn't find one there, it will use
the mwpr.cfg from the folder containin mwpr.exe.</li>
<li>mwpr.cfg contains the following parameters (in this example using MyMission.xml as the sample mission
xml file name:
  <ol>
    <li><b>mode:</b> <tt>adjust</tt> or <tt>scan</tt>. With 'adjust', mwpr will write a MyMission_adj.xml
    into the same folder as the original MyMission.xml.  The MyMission.xml file will not be altered. If
    mode is set to 'scan', the MyMission_adj.xml will not be produced.  Instead, mwpr will output the list
    of affected waypoints as comma-delimited floating-point values into mwpr.log suitable for importing into
    Excel.  With mode set to 'scan', mwpr will simulate the application of the randomization factors onto the
    lat/long/altitude values and include those in the mwpr.log file also.
    </li>
    <li><b>mso_descr:</b> this contains a string for a partial match with the Descr value of any 
    moving scenery object (matching starts from the first char, and continues for the
    length of the mso_descr value).  <i>Only</i> moving scenery objects which begin with these characters will be
    selected to be scanned or adjusted.  Austrian Soaring - Day 3 contains gliders following three quite
    different routes (pre-randomization).  The MSO Descr values are 'gliderA..', 'gliderB..' and 'gliderC..'
    where the 20 gliders following route A are called 'gliderA01' to 'gliderA20', etc.  Thus you can
    randomize the different routes by three passes of mwpr, using a different 'mso_descr' in mwpr.cfg each time.
    If you want all MSO's adjusted the same, leave this blank.
    </li>
    <li><b>wp_descr:</b> Same idea as 'mso_descr', but this time <i>within those mso's selected</i> only
    waypoints with a 'Descr' value partially matching this string will be included for scanning or adjusting.
    In Austrian Soaring - Day 3, waypoints on the entrance or exit from a thermal have Descr values
    beginning 'WPT ', whereas general cross-country waypoints are 'WP '.  With two passes of mwpr, the general
    cross-country waypoints could be randomized across larger ranges than the thermal entry/exit. The image
    below illustrates this, in particular where the routes cross Latitude 13 (where there's a thermal
    in the mission). If you want all WP's adjusted
    the same, leave this blank.
    </li>
    <li><b>lat_delta_max, lat_delta_min:</b> the acceptable adjustment <i>in degrees</i> of the latitude
    value.  If the waypoints represent a glider flying along the North-facing slope, it is sensible to allow
    a greater positive <i>max</i> value than negative <i>min</i> value of latitude.  I.e. some gliders will
    fly further out from the slope, but you shouldn't get planes bumping into the ridge. A value of 
    +/-0.015 gives approx a 1 minute adjustment either way, which works well for gliders.
    </li>
    <li><b>long_delta_max, long_delta_min:</b> as above, but for longitude</li>
    <li><b>alt_delta_max, alt_delta_min:</b> as above, but for altitude in <i>feet</i></li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Be careful to adjust the starting WorldPositions and current waypoint of each mobile scenery object
correctly.  This will determine both their initial starting point and their relative timings along the
common route (i.e. their separation at the first waypoint is determined by where they started from). This
step is the <b>most significant part of the manual effort</b> in defining the mobile scenery.
</li>
<li>Note that you can and should adjust the <i>speeds</i> of your mobile scenery objects so they fly at
slightly different speeds.
</li>

<h2>Illustration of output</h2>
<p>I used the following steps to create this Excel chart:</p>
<ol>
<li>Used mwpr to adjust the 50 mobile scenery objects (gliders) in Austrian Soaring - Day 3, using
several passes with different WP filters and randomization ranges</li>
<li>Changed mwpr.cfg to have mode=scan, deleted the existing mwpr.log, and dropped the new xml file onto mwpr.exe</li>
again.  This generated a mwpr.log listing all the waypoint values ready for import into Excel</li>
<li>In Excel, I used 'Data', 'Import External Data', to read mwpr.log as a comma-delimited text file, and then
created an XY chart from the first LAT and LONG columns.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Note: from this chart you can see that this example include a few glitches... this is indeed 
the case in the
final version of Austrian Soaring - Day 3, such that half-a-dozen of the gliders will head off in the wrong
direction at some point on the course.  This doesn't affect the mission and I wasn't aware of the bugs until
creating the 'scan' mode of the tool after shipping Day 3. The error was 
from when I created the scenery objects, not
from mwpr.</i></p>
