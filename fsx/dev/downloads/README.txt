RidgeTest FSX Mission

This is a mission for FSX DEVELOPERS to help understand the RidgeLift object.

RidgeTest is set just north of Minden, Nevada.

The mission places 8 RidgeLift areas in a circle, and sets the wind to
zero degrees, 16 knots (i.e. from the North).


INSTALLATION:

1) You must install the ridgebox scenery object.  See the ridge_v4 folder README.txt.

2) Create the 'Soaring' category by:
      copy "Categories/banner_soaring.bmp" into the FSX "Categories" folder
      copy "Categories/SoaringFSCategories" into the FSX "Categories" folder

3) Install the RidgeTest mission by:
      copy the "Soaring" folder into the FSX "Missions" folder

USAGE:

If you fly around the boxes, you should detect ridge lift according
to the values given in ridge_strength_wind_16_at_0.jpg

If you checked the 'edit mission' checkbox before starting the mission, you can
change the wind and see what happens.
