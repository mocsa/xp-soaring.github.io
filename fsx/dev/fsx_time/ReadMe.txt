About:
------
 This is the totally redone and updated World-Times script. With the help of this clock
 script you can simultaneously view the time in 5 different cities covering 5 different
 continents. In all you can find out the time in 178 given cities situated in the 6
 major continents. Just choose the city from the respective drop down menu and the time
 and date will automatically be displayed in the text box immediately below. There are
 radio buttons which give the users the option to either see the time in the 12 Hour or
 24 Hour format. This script supports Daylight Saving Time (DST).

 The script can be set to open with the times of particular cities in each group showing.
 This can be done as instructed in the 'theData.js' file.
