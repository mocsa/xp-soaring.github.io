<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>We want glider flight models that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Accurately reflect the glider <a href="../dev/polars/polar.html">polar</a> i.e. it's sink rate at every speed,
        flap setting, and ballast load.
    </li>
    <li>Behave accurately near the stall - glider pilots get close to this, e.g. when thermalling, much more often
        than power pilots.
    </li>
    <li>Have airbrakes and flaps that work progressively and accurately. It's virtually impossible to land a
        high-performance sailplane without effective flaps and airbrakes.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Current status</h2>

<p>X-Plane looks like it has quite detailed control over how the flight model behaves although this involves
    complex manipulation of a hidden 3d model. But with effort it seems possible to get good flying characteristics.
